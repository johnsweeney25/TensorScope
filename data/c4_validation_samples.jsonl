This pathological condition leads to a reduced quality of life in most affected individuals. Schwann cells (SCs) play a crucial role in the repair of PNI. Effective agents that promote SC activation may facilitate and accelerate peripheral nerve repair. Thymoquinone (TQ), a bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds, has an antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and neuroprotective properties. In the present study, the neuroprotective efficacy of TQ was investigated by using a laser microdissection technique in a mouse PNI model.\nMETHODS: Single cells were isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRGs) of 6-8-week-old mice, maintained in defined culture conditions and treated with or without TQ at different concentrations. Axons were cut (axotomy) using a controllable laser microbeam to model axonal injury in vitro. Under fluorescence microscopy, cell viability was evaluated using the fluorescent dyes. The behavior of the cells was continuously monitored with time-lapse video microscopy.\nRESULTS: TQ significantly increased neuronal survival by promoting the survival and proliferation of SCs and fibroblasts, as well as the migration of SCs. Furthermore, TQ improved the ability to extend neurites of axotomized neurons. The regenerative effect of TQ was dose-dependent suggesti"}

When the ribs are touched, it can be difficult to breathe deeply. Ankylosing spondylitis affects men more than women. Signs and symptoms usually begin in early adulthood. Inflammation can also occur in other parts of the body, most often in the eyes. Ankylosing spondylitis cannot be cured, but treatments can reduce their symptoms and possibly delay the progression of the disease. It is a type of arthritis which especially affects the spine. Mostly men at their teen age get attack by this disease.\nIts actual causing reason is still unknown.

And within that five-year period, people hit the ground running,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the report, the contribution is based on more than $129 million of implied annual tax payments to the province, and federal transfer payments, which amounted to $4,200 per capita in 2017.

Read abstract here.\nIn all the debate through the years about the cause in the rise in c-section rates, the role money plays gets little attention. The public is loath to think that the cesarean section being performed on a loved one results from the physician needing to make a boat payment rather than patient need. The doctors, of course, blame the lawyers claiming that lawsuits make the doctors do more cesarean sections to protect themselves from litigation. In an interesting new study available from the Social Science Research Network, MIT and University of British Columbia researchers analyzed records of births in California and Texas and have found that when the patient is a physician she is 10% less likely to receive a c-section delivery. The authors conclude that financial incentives are most likely responsible for this behavior.\nPost a Comment to \"New Study suggests doctors do more cesarean sections because of money.

Ever since KJA and Brian got together and announced that they would be releasing Dune 7, a book which Frank had apparently been working on shortly before he died, I was understandably excited. It was just a few years before this announcement that I had finally worked my way to the end of the Dune series (Chapterhouse: Dune) only to find that it ended on a cliffhanger note with numerous loose ends.\nFor example, what was this mysterious enemy that the Honored Matres were fleeing? Who were the old man and woman from Duncan\u2019s visions? What was Duncan\u2019s role in all this; i.e. was he the new Kwisatz Haderach or something even greater?

{"text": "Stemming from a San Diego dog bite injury case that occurred on June 18, 2011, Alba Corenlio and Carla Cornelio, owners of the pit bulls that mauled an elderly neighbor, are expected to stand trial for manslaughter, a felony charge of owning mischievous animals that caused a death and six misdemeanors relating to the attack. According to an article in the U-T San Diego, 75-year-old Emako Mendoza was viciously attacked by the two pit bulls when she went to the backyard of her home to get her morning newspaper. Mendoza lived next door to the Cornelios in Paradise Hills. The two pit bulls had gotten into her yard through a gap in the fence. After the attack, the two pit bulls and their three-week-old puppies were euthanized.\nThe attack was so severe that Mendoza\u2019s left arm and leg left had to be amputated. The vicious attack had also caused her to suffer a heart attack. Months of rehabilitation did not improve Mendoza\u2019s condition. She died on December 24, 2011.\nThe Cornelios will likely pose another seemingly plausible argument in their defense. They will likely argue that they should not be held legally responsible for Mendoza\u2019s death because pit bulls are domesticated animals, and the rule is that owners of domesticated animals cannot be held liable for injuries caused by such animals. Assuming that the court considers a pit bull to be a domesticated animal, the Cornelios may be successful in their argument. However, as our Escondido dog bite lawyer is well aware of tort law, "}

Colorado Civil Rights Commission, saying that the baker had the First Amendment right to not bake and decorate a wedding cake for a gay couple as that violated his sincerely held religious beliefs.\nMost likely nothing. The decision is very narrowly tailored to where strongly held religious beliefs clash with other civil rights. The court was careful to note that the baker was willing to make a birthday cake for the gay couple, but not a wedding cake, as he felt that would violate his religious beliefs.\nThey pointed out that no one would expect that a \"member of the clergy who objects to gay marriage on moral and religious grounds\" could be \"compelled to perform the ceremony without denial of his or her right to the free exercise of religion.\" Yet, we wouldn't want to extend that protection to everyone and everything related to marriage. Could a chair rental company refuse to rent chairs to a wedding they disagreed with?\nUnder this decision, no. The court relied on the owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop's description that a cake is an artistic expression and therefore covered by the First Amendment. The result would have been different if the baker \"refused to sell any goods or any cakes for gay weddings.\"\nThe person refusing has sincerely held religious beliefs.\nIf you, or one of your employees, has a strong religious belief that prohibits him or her from creating somethin"}

But for the economists this does not mean a return to economic growth.\nOne might have thought that, with Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, realism would get the upper hand, all the more so as the 0.5% growth mainly rests on 0.4% growth in household consumption \u2026 which is partly linked to bad weather, the lousy spring having made energy bills balloon. Growth without jobs or investment: France continued to destroy jobs \u2013 27,800 in the same period, as against 8,300 in the preceding quarter. The government has not commented on that figure.

Still, there are more than a few economists, political scientists and conspiracy theorists who believe ideology is irrelevant.

History is full of examples of important ideas transforming mankind, such as monotheism, experimental science and double-entry bookkeeping (which led to the creation of partnerships and corporations, the building blocks of modern capitalism). Human beings are willing to make great sacrifices, including their lives, to defend or advance what they believe.\nFormal education is only one of many methods by which people receive and come to accept ideas.

{"text": "An earwax candle is a tool that is said to clear the ear of wax using heat conducted from the candle. There are safety issues involved with these candles, but many people swear that they work, and help with a variety of issues related to the ears and health.\nWhat Is an Earwax Candle?\nEar candling is the process of burning a special candle made of cotton, linen, or other natural cloth while the unlit end is placed in the ear. While the candle burns, it is claimed that earwax and other toxins are removed.\nWhat Stores Sell Ear Candles?\nThis process is also called ear coning. The earwax candle is made by winding the fabric into a tight, narrow cone with a hollow center, and then soaking the cone in beeswax so that it will harden and burn like a real candle.\nThe subject of the ear candling starts off by laying on one side. The ear candle is then placed into the ear, and the opposite end is lit. Sometimes the candle is first fed through a paper plate or other tray that rests on the side of the head, to catch the dripping wax and prevent burns.\nThe theory behind this practice is that the heat from the flame in conjunction with the suction from the opposite ear on a flat surface creates a vacuum. This in turn draws out toxins and dissolves earwax, collecting these undesired elements inside the cone. Each ear receives one or two candles, depending on how much wax and debris is thought to be present. The candles themselves are burned for several minutes at a time, then extinguished and"}

Oh, boy, no matter what\u2019s thrown at us, the season is started and there\u2019s no turning back for the next four months.\nPutting together the box for today, however, a lot of those beginning of season fears fall away as the lettuce looks really good as we\u2019re harvesting, there\u2019s more broccoli than I thought, and, yes, we actually got a cultivation in with the tractor before this weekend\u2019s rain. A sign which gave me even greater comfort was the garter snake which surprised me this morning near the lettuce patch. Like any reptile or amphibian, the snake is a sign of good health and I appreciate their presence even though I\u2019m deathly afraid of them. It was almost as if he made his appearance today to welcome us to a new season.\nArugula (bunch of greens with elongated oak-like leaves): I like these in pasta or raw in a Italian-style salad with olive oil, balsamic, and parmesan cheese\u2026you can also make an "}

It was mild and unsettled for most of November with Storm Diana on the 28th. Atlantic westerlies dominated in December with Storm Deirdre on the 15th.\nThe first week of December was mild and unsettled with low-pressure systems and associated weather fronts traversing the country frequently in a mainly westerly airflow. This gave rain or showers every day with windy conditions at times, especially on the 7th and 8th. The second week continued with the generally unsettled theme, although less active on the 9th and 10th, as a transient area of high pressure moved over the country. High pressure established itself over Scandinavia on the 12th and the airflow over Ireland backed to south or southeast up to the 15th. The bulk of the rain during this period fell in the South. On the 15th, Storm Deirdre deepened rapidly as it moved across the country giving widespread heavy rain and very strong winds. The remainder of the third week was Atlantic dominated again in a south or south-westerly air flow with rain or showers on most days. It settled down towards Christmas as high pressure built from the south over the country giving a mostly dry Christmas and final week of the month and year."}

You provide standard soldering tools: a soldering iron + solder and small (\"flush\") wire clippers, as well as a Phillips head screwdriver.\nThe Three Fives circuit is a direct implementation of the \"equivalent circuit\" from the NE555 datasheet, built up using resistors and individual 2N3904 and 2N3906 transistors. It comes with terminal posts and solder points so that you can actually connect to it and build up classic 555 timer and oscillator circuits. Using those terminal posts and solder points, you can hook up with with bare wires, lugs, alligator clips, and/or solder joints-- however you see fit. And unlike the chip version, you can even hook up probes to monitor what goes on inside the circuit."}

Its first victory was scored by the pilot whose story is inextricably interwoven with that of his unit - the \u2018Blue Max' recipient Julius Buckler. He was largely responsible for inspiring the unit's unique Esprit de Corps, expressed in its famous and unique \u2018battle-cry' of \u2018Malaula!' Indeed, in its final days the unit gained the nickname Zirkus Buckler, or the \u2018Buckler Circus'. Besides Buckler, Jasta 17 boasted such aces as Karl Strasser, Alfred Fleischer and Christian Donhauser. In addition, the roster included colourful characters like the successful Jewish airman Jakob Wolff, who at over 48 years of age was the oldest German fighter pilot of the war. The story of this illustrious unit is told with many first-hand accounts by Buckler, Fleischer and others, as well as dozens of rare archival photos of the unit's beautifully decorated fighter aircraft.\nGreg VanWyngarden has had a lifelong interest in World War 1 aviation and has been particularly active in researching the colours and markings of German fighter aircraft. He has written many books for Osprey and has co-authored three previous titles with Norman Franks: Fokker Dr I Aces of World War 1 and Fokker D VII Aces of World War 1, Volume 1 and Volume 2.

{"text": "The coot feeds on pondweeds and invertebrates (4); it dives rather clumsily to obtain food, and returns to the surface rapidly thanks to its cork-like buoyancy (6). Unlike ducks, coots bring their food to the surface before eating it; this results in frequent cases of food stealing (4). They are opportunistic birds, and may feed in grasslands at certain times of the year (6). During winter, large flocks may gather on large lakes and reservoirs (10), these gatherings are relatively peaceful compared to the fierce territorial aggression seen during the breeding season (2). The nest, a mound of dead reeds, is usually built amongst emergent vegetation (6). From mid-March, between 6 and 9 speckled eggs are laid (occasionally up to 15 eggs, though these large clutches may be laid by more than one female (10)). The eggs are incubated by both parents for up to 24 days (6). The chicks leave the nest a few days after hatching, and reach independence at around 8 weeks of age (6).

{"text": "No need to rely on just grenades and timed explosives if you've got this smelly little beauty.\nThe stink bomb has been the odd man out in Fortnite's list of portable explosives. Many see the regular grenades, clingers, and timed explosives as far more effective ways to blow away the competition. But have no doubt, the stink bomb can be incredibly useful in short range, mid range, and long range scenarios throughout a match with its deadly assault on the senses. With the aid of our Fortnite stink bomb guide it'll be a difficult item to pass up, even if it doesn't smell great.\nThe smelly explosive is a common pickup that can be found in chests or out in the open: it\u2019s a blue bottle with a green substance in it. It has a similar throw range to other hand held items, it has a small area of effect after exploding, and it deals five damage per half second for nine total seconds. That adds up to a total of 90 damage if the opponents takes the brunt of the attack, just shy of knocking out a full health bar.\nThere are a number of strategies that the stink bomb can support, even more so than some of the other explosives since its effects linger longer than the typical grenade.\nIt\u2019s a common to get locked into a mid to long range firefight with little chance to reposition, pinned down by an opponent with the higher ground. Any step outside cover will lead to a face full of bullets.\nThe gas cloud that stink bombs create can offer a bit of respite from the eyes of the enemy. Each bomb emi"}

Basically, the problem I'm having is that when it comes time to replace my fleet with new planes, there's nothing \"new\" to replace them with. It would be cool to see some type of fleet renewal program, but impossible to \"invent\" new Boeing and Airbus planes, and cheesy to make fake designs for the year 2035 or so and beyond.\nWhich is when it hit me--why not allow users to go back and start the game in 1965-1970 if they want, then add in aircraft from that time period. DC-8s, DC-9s, 707s, 720s, 727s, 737-200s, Caravelles, etc., then move forward through time to where the DC-10, 747 and L-1011 become available, then the MD-80 and 737-300/500 series, and on up into the airliners available in-game currently. You could also put a \"used aircraft market\" in-game, where players can get older airliners on the cheap, but they have shorter service lives and require more spending on maintenance (i.e., a new aircraft has a 30-year life in-game, but depending upon the age of the used aircraft being purchased, it may have a life of only 10 years). You could also, for the sake of realism, set it up so that airliners are only available to be purchased new up until a couple of years after their production in real life ended, but those designs would be available for a used-plane purchase for 20-30 years after produ"}

The strategy worked for him in qualifying superbly and here it preserved and protected his race win, giving the Spaniard a comfortable lead over his closest competitors of the Red Bull Racing duo. Alonso controlled the race with ease, and it was only in the latter stages of the race that he had any company in the form of a resurgent Jenson Button and then a suddenly interested Sebastian Vettel. But unlike Silverstone he had enough left in reserve to manage Button, who had chipped the gap down to under a second in places.\nIt would have been a sweet result if Lewis Hamilton could have emulated his team mate\u2019s result on his 200th race, however it wasn\u2019t meant to be.

{"text": "7th September 1914, Luton: White feathers have been sent to young single men in Luton who have not enlisted. Some of the sillier girls have been convinced by what they read in the papers that any young man not in uniform is an unpatriotic shirker. They do not seem to realise that with so many men joining the army even some former soldiers are finding it difficult to re-enlist. One young man who had served as an officer in the Territorials tried to rejoin his battalion as soon as the war began. The battalion was at full strength and he has been waiting for a commission in another regiment. He would be happy to join the ranks, but has heard that new Territorial battalions are being formed and hopes to be needed by one of them. Despite this he received a white feather in the post. It may also be that single men have family responsibilities, caring for parents or siblings, or are not fit enough to be accepted into the Forces. They say that although Lord Kitchener asked for 200,000 men to join up, over 300,000 have now enlisted and the War Office does not have the resources to equip or train all the new recruits. Even if there were cause to believe a young man may be shirking his duty and to tell him so with a white feather, it would surely be better to give it to him personally and give him a chance to explain himself rather than to take the coward\u2019s course and send a feather anonymously."}

{"text": "Rochester Webelos Cub Scouts were lucky to be able to participate in maple syrup making in Rochester, MA last month. Our neighbor, Wendy Keeler invited us over to watch the process. She taps red maples rather than sugar maples since that is what is available in our area. The maple syrup has a great taste, a little more vanilla flavor, than traditional syrup from sugar maples. She had 11 tapped trees on her property and the cold nights and relatively warm days provided overflowing jugs of sap. The boys watched as she boiled the sap from the trees outside over a arch system fire. The boiling releases a lot of steam so boiling outside is preferable. The boys were surprised to learn that it takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup. It also takes 24 hours to boil the thin sap into a thick syrup. We got a taste of the finished product and it was delicious.\nWe also brought a 5 gallon bucket of sap home, thanks to Wendy, and boiled it down to one mason jar worth of syrup. It took 24 hours but it was worth every minute. The syrup was delicious. We are definitely rationing it to make it last as long as possible. It\u2019s a lot of work but the finished product is so sweet.\nI really enjoy working with the Cub Scouts to learn new experiences.

{"text": "If we are permitted to be Christians, this has its profound meaning and purpose and springs from God's eternal thoughts about us (Jeremiah 31:3). God has drawn us to Him out of pure goodness, compassion and mercy. We are now earnestly requested to humbly approach this incomprehensible Creator, as a people permitted to belong to God. We are not at eye-level height with the Almighty, but only those pardoned who still do not conceive the depth of this concept. We have no cause to think that we can approach God in any other manner, but in humility and respectful fear of God. God is not our mate. Who can fathom HIM? If we approach God with this Biblically-desired attitude, then God will reveal Himself to us and gladly have to do with us. And beyond that, He will also supply our living needs. To this it is written in Matthew 6:33 ''But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and His righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.'' God's righteousness is His grace, revealed to the world through Jesus Christ. God became human because no-one out of his own asked for God. The grace always comes from above, not from below! The Kingdom of God came to us \u2013 and many have twisted it around and haughtily mocked everything which was holy and precious to God. This is still true today. But, if we have faith, then this applies especially to us: Humble yourself before the LORD and HE will lift you up!

{"text": "Dimethyl ether (DME) is a non-toxic fuel with high H/C ratio and high volumetric energy density, and could be served as an ideal source of H2/syngas production for application in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC). This study presents results of DME partial oxidation over a 1.5 wt% Pt/Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 catalyst under the condition of gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 15000-60000 ml/(g\u00b7h), molar ratio of O2/DME of 0.5 and 500-700 \u00b0C, and this temperature range was also the operation temperature range for intermediate temperature SOFC. The results indicated that the catalyst showed good activity for the selective partial oxidation of DME to H2/syngas. Under the working conditions investigated, DME was completely converted. Increase in reaction temperature enhanced the amount of syngas, but lowered the H2/CO ratio and yield of methane; while increase in reaction GHSV resulted in only slight variation in the distribution of products. The good catalytic activity of Pt supported on Ce0.4Zr0.6O2 for the partial oxidation of DME may be directly associated with the good oxygen storage capacity of the support, which is worth of further investigation to develop materials for application in SOFC. \u00a9 2008 CAS/DICP.\nChen, Y. and Shao, Z. and Xu, N. 2008.

Retsos, being born in South Africa, was eligible to represent Greece through his familial heritage, and made his senior international debut on 31st August 2017 in a 2018 World Cup qualifier against Estonia in Pireaus.

With a continually reducing inventory of homes on the market and the interest rates still at an all time low, I believe we'll continue to see strong sales. This week, on the Nevada side of South Lake Tahoe, there were no foreclosures for sale and just one short sale! The rest of Nevada is still seeing enough foreclosures to keep them as the #2 state in the U.S. in the number of foreclosured homes but that isn't the case in Lake Tahoe.\nThere has been more activity on the higher end market of homes for sale. One estate just sold in Cave Rock for over $20,000,000 and another in Skyland for over $13,000,000. There is much more trust in the economy and it shows in these large purchases. Buyers are willing to pay for the kind of home they desire.\nThe higher priced homes are finally seeing increased sales, even though the above figures for the whole year saw a slight decline.

We do not see the pedestrian bridge Eiserner Steg which crosses the Main in the middle of this panorama and connects the R\u00f6merberg, the central market square, with the southern shore and the museums district. The reason is that this linear panorama was created from two seperate panoramas left and right of the bridge and those perspectives combined eliminated it. Both seperate panoramas are added in the adjoining detail images.\nThe banking district lies between the old town and the train station and is not only dominated by skyscrapers but also by construction sites. The dominating skyscrapers in this view are the Commerzbank Tower on the right, the highest building in Germany, and left of it the Taunusturm, the Eurotower (former seat of the EZB), the Gallileo-High Rise, the Silver Tower and finally the NM-1 High Rise standing at the shore.

If you want tips on finding the best prices, check out our post How to Buy the Clothes You Want at Clearance Prices. It just makes good financial sense to make your clothing last as long as possible.\nGet the most life from your wardrobe with the following regimen.\nUse good hangers. Solid wood hangers help keep the shoulders in your jackets or sweaters intact. In contrast, wire or thin plastic hangers cause those annoying and unsightly bumps in the shoulders, stretching and warping.\nDo your laundry inside out. Color loss occurs in clothing not just from washing. However, from the clothes rubbing against each other. Therefore, to prevent jeans, pants, or any other items from fading as quickly, turn them inside out before washing.\nStuff your shoes. Wad up a newspaper or packing paper and stuff them into your shoes and boots to help them keep their shape longer.\nWatch the fabric softener. Do not use fabric softener when washing workout or outdoor clothing designed to wick moisture. The fabric softener clogs the micropores in the clothing preventing them from wicking away sweat and moisture.\nHang an indoor clothesline. Even if the sun is not out, or you live in an apartment, you can still hang a short indoor clothesline to dry socks, t-shirts, bras, underwear, and other items. This prevents damage and fading done to gentler materials in the dryer. "}

{"text": "Coruscation: Can Tesla be agile to make cars ?\nCan Tesla be agile to make cars ?\nWhat many people enamored with the idea of agile fail to realize is where the limits are. Agile is efficient when the cost of making a change is lower than the cost of an iteration. In other words, your iterations have to be profitable (at least in aggregate.).\nDeploying software to a server costs almost nothing, so you can iterate every five minutes and make money. Except when you make a mistake and deploy something broken, which can cost you in damaged customer reputation. In many cases these are costs that can be absorbed, but fail too often and the product is doomed.\nAgile works by holding time and effort constant, but letting scope vary. That means using agile techniques to handle hardware projects where scope can't vary (like deploying routers to remote sites) can fail much more easily. If any component is delayed, the whole product is delayed, and other expenses rise: rescheduling installers often has a cascading effect on the rest of the project."}

{"text": "Should Kids Lift Weights? By Brett Klika C.S.C.S.\nIn working with a large number of youth, this is one of the more common questions I get from concerned parents. Urban legends of stunted growth, fractured growth plates, and prematurely inflated physiques have made parents, and society for that matter, reticent to involve youth in weight training.\nThe fact is, there is no scientific evidence to suggest that there is a perfect chronological age to start weight training. Research has not demonstrated any negative health consequences for weight training in youth, assuming proper movement is introduced and enforced concurrently with appropriate progressive increases in training load.\nDespite what myths have been created around the subject, the current data suggests youth weight training injuries are primarily due to equipment accidents (weight falling on them, tripping in the weight room, etc.) or overzealous coaching rendering improper program introduction and progression.\nProper resistance training in youth has been demonstrated to improve fitness, favorably affect bone density, improve movement ability, and decrease the likelihood of athletic injury. Weight training is merely loaded movement. More simply put, it\u2019s challenged movement. If basic movement becomes easy, we can challenge by adding something extra to continue to provide a training effect.\nIf a child can do a squat pattern perfectly for repetitions, holding a 2- pound medicine ball adds additional load.

{"text": "Puerto Morelos, the typical Mexican fishing village in Quintana Roo has lots going for it. One of the main attractions is the second largest barrier reef in the world, the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, which lies just offshore. In 1998 this section of the reef was declared a protected National Marine Park. As a result, it\u2019s less visited, healthier and more spectacular than the reef near Playa del Carmen and Cancun. We learnt about the reef and snorkelling in Puerto Morelos soon after arriving in the village. It was instantly added to our list of things to do. After all, there was no way we could live in Puerto Morelos for six weeks and miss out on that.\nAt first, we hoped to snorkel the reef from the shore independently but it seemed it was prohibited due to the reefs protected status. The only way to snorkel the reef was with an accredited guide and always wearing a life jacket or snorkel vest. After looking at several tours to take us to snorkel the reef (both with agencies in town and independent guides on the beach) we decided to take a Classic Reef Tour with Wet Set Diving Adventures.\nWet Set Diving Adventures provided us with a complimentary Reef Snorkel Tour which I\u2019ve reviewed below.

{"text": "Stone Cold Bastards is a standalone book all about gargoyles trying to save the last remaining humans from the demons. I normally have a hard time with books told in a male POV and narrated by a guy, but this actually worked very well for me! Thanks so much for gifting me a copy, Melissa.\nWe quickly dive right into the story by meeting some of the grotesques, think gargoyles but don't ever call them that. The first bit of the story is told in Mordecai aka Morty's POV and we learn that the grotesques and the few remaining humans that aren't possessed are holed up in a cathedral. They're hiding from the demons that possessed humans who plan on taking over the world. With more and more sanctuaries falling under the demons sieges, theirs winds up being the last one standing. While the first half of the book is us learning about the day to day lives in the sanctuary, the last half is full of action. The demons want to take over and plan on taking down their cathedral by force. With the battle brewing, the humans and grotesques have to try their hardest to beat the hordes of demons any way they can.\nStone Cold Bastards is a unique read that had me rooting for the underdogs. The characters were engaging and while they could be a bit crass it suited their situation well. The world reminded me a bit of The Walking Dead as I was listening, though the demons are able to talk, fire a gun, etc. While the story does cycle through several different POVs it was easy to distinguish what was g"}

{"text": "When you are ready to purchase your first aquarium, one of the first things you learn is how to properly cycle the aquarium and how to slowly introduce new fish to avoid ammonia spikes while the colonies of beneficial bacteria are developing. That's easy enough to follow -- but what about when you have to move an existing community of fish to a new home? Maybe you moved and have to re-establish the aquarium, maybe you're moving to a larger or even a smaller tank; whatever the reason, there are ways to safely move the fish without as much risk of ammonia spikes.\nA properly cycled tank contains a healthy colony of bacteria that breaks down ammonia from a fish's waste and uneaten food into nitrites and then into nitrates. In a healthy tank, there should be 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites and less than 40ppm nitrates (20ppm if you have invertebrates such as snails or shrimp). Without sufficient amounts of beneficial bacteria, ammonia and nitrite in the water may be fatal to fish.\nBeneficial bacteria live all through the water and on every underwater surface in the aquarium, but the water itself carries a very low concentration of bacteria so it's not very effective to simply transfer water from the old aquarium to the new in order to maintain bacteria levels. Ideally, you will be able to transfer some old filter media to the new aquarium, or even a handful of gravel or fake plants that will all have beneficial bacteria on them. Make sure that the materials of your choice stay wet with tank"}

The frame was highlighted by a Snayder Ruiz two-run single, and a Kaleb Hanks two-run triple. Ruiz finished game two with three RBIs while Hanks and Diogen Ceballos each drove in two. Jose Mieses, Ceballos and Adam Barrett had two hits apiece, both doubles for Ceballos, as the Tigers rapped out 12 hits in the victory.\nThe Reivers (40-14, 19-3) got seven runs back between the fourth and fifth innings to pull within two, but MCC came back with three in the sixth.

{"text": "Positive affirmations can help us raise our vibrations into activating changes in the brain which release negative thought patterns, making room for spiritual transformations of the miraculous kind. They create an energy all their own. Affirming words, thoughts and actions give us the miraculous ability to raise the frequency of thought to change the body, mind and soul into healing action and manifestation.\nWhen thoughts are repeated, they become beliefs. Belief brings in our reality. As we have formed thought patterns which do not serve us well as we go about our lives, we must form new ones to replace those we have decided to let go.\nHow do I heal this with your guidance by incorporating higher knowledge?\nDuring meditation speak with your guides and loved ones intuitively and out loud. Listen and see through your third eye vision the words, people, places, things that will be providing these answers. Breathe in your affirmations and feel their energy flow through all your chakra centers. Courage takes practice.\nRemember that peace is an energy. You are the creator. In most situations you have time to make a choice. Is this my circus? Are these thoughts coming from my true self or of those around me?

That you cannot kill your noisy neighbor is morally self-explanatory. Yet the less straightforward laws can often be most interesting ones, particularly if they undergo constitutional court review.\nThe Biblical Ten Commandments, standards to live by, were delivered from Mount Sinai by Moses.

They are debated in legislatures before being passed and taking effect. In a perfect world we'd like to believe that all sides are heard for all proposed legislation, the final vote the culmination of a rational process in which each legislator has acted freely, without political pressure, according to conscience.

With its characteristic, high front fender, striking flyline and short, high rear, the BMW G 310 GS features classic elements of its big GS sibling models. Its compact proportions with a short wheelbase, a 19-inch front wheel and extended spring travel make for a typical upright posture, promising an agile, nimble riding response.\nLike the G 310 R, the G 310 GS is also designed for the world market. It takes diverse fuel qualities as well as meeting all emissions standards and local requirements. It is at home on all the roads of the world, bringing the hallmark BMW premium aspirations to the segment below 500 cc.\nThe centrepiece of the new BMW G 310 GS is the 313 cc liquid-cooled single-cylinder engine known from the G 310 R with four valves and two overhead camshafts together with electronic fuel injection. The capacity of 313 cc results from a bore of 80 millimetres and a stroke of 62.1 millimetres.\nA salient feature of the single-cylinder engine in the G 310 GS is the fact that its cylinder is tilted to the rear and its cylinder head is rotated by 180 degrees: intake at the front, outlet at the rear.

Peat forms at the bottom of closed water bodies (usually, bogs) covered with weed and residue of various (including medicinal) plants in the anaerobic conditions. For therapeutic purposes, medicinal mud of peat origin heated to 46\u201348\u00b0C is used. Medicinal mud packs are used to treat various inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Mud application improves peripheral circulation and tissue nutrition, treats chronic inflammatory diseases and has anti-allergic properties; therefore, medicinal peat packs help to treat joint, gynaecological, peripheral nervous system and other diseases.\nGelatinous organic matter with colloidal structure called sapropel takes several thousands of years to form from aquatic fauna and flora at the bottom of lakes. Sapropel is a peloid (mud) of freshwater bodies and bogs. Its composition is the result of a complex mud formation process. Sapropel is formed of decayed plant and animal plankton (small organisms floating in the water), benthos (organisms that live on the bottom of water bodies), and large aquatic plants, i.e. macrophytes (at the end of vegetation). Organic matter from the shores eroded by waves as well as matter carried by surface runoff, rivers, streams and air currents gets mixed in the mud.

In slug-prone environments, it is better to forego mulching, and either compost your leaves or manage them in a separate pile to produce leaf mold. Then, use the compost or leaf mold as soil amendments. Should there be slug eggs present in the compost or leaf mold, allowing it to dry in the sun for a few days will kill most of them. This is also a great job for chickens, who happily remove slugs and other creatures from leaf piles."}

Some would argue that trading currency for gold in the hopes of one-day trading it for more currency defeats the very purpose of gold ownership.\nOwning gold and saving in it should act as an insurance policy against potential failure of currency.

The present study aimed to describe the changes in blood biomarkers in collegiate football (FB) (n=31) and cross country (XC) (n=29; 16 female, 13 male) athletes across a competitive season. These athletes were training and living at a moderate altitude (1655 m). The study used a database of previously collected blood biomarkers, that were regularly used to monitor athlete\u2019s health and performance. All three groups (FB, MXC, FXC) had significant changes (p<0.05, tested by a linear mixed model) in both hematological biomarkers and muscle damage biomarkers. Although significant changes were observed, the means of the hematological blood biomarkers stayed within the normal reference ranges, and from a variance components analysis we observed that most of the variability was due to individual variability. Female XC had the most out of range hematology values (14%), which may be indicative of differences in hematological maintenance or pathology. Overall the hematological analyses suggest no significant decrements to oxygen carrying capacity across the season for FB, MXC, or FXC. Muscle damage biomarkers however, had means that were above the normal reference ranges, and the variance was mostly attributed to changes over time, rather than individ"}

However, there is a tendency for many villagers to go to the clinic and ask for \u201csut marasin\u201d (an antibiotic shot) for any kind of illness that they have. Today the students learned that antibiotics should not be used to treat common colds, and also what signs to look for to know when a child really does need to go to the clinic and get medication.\nWe also learned about tuberculosis and the dangers of smoking. TB is a leading killer of adults in PNG, and so we learned about how it is spread, what the symptoms are and how it can be treated.

Learn more.\nChapter 13 bankruptcy allows debtors to wipe out certain types of debt that are not dischargeable in a Chapter 7. This means that if you file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you may be able to eliminate more of your debts than you can in a Chapter 7. Read on to learn more about the kinds of debts you can discharge in Chapter 13 bankruptcy but not in Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nWhich Debts are Discharged in Bankruptcy?\nThe following are the most common types of debt a Chapter 13 discharge will eliminate but a Chapter 7 discharge will not.\nIf you willfully or maliciously damage another person\u2019s property, you can\u2019t discharge any debts that result from your actions in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. But you can discharge debts related to willful and malicious damage to property in Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, keep in mind that you can\u2019t eliminate any debts arising out of your willful or malicious acts that cause personal injury or death in Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\nIf you incur a debt to pay off nondischargeable tax obligations (such as paying your tax liability with a credit card), you can discharge that debt in Chapter 13 bankruptcy but not in Chapter 7.\nIf you incur debts (other than domestic support obligations) to your spouse, former spouse, or child through a divorce decree, property settlement, separation agreement, or other related proceeding, you can discharge the"}

In the middle of the busiest fiscal year end job rush, I managed to submit P/L, B/S, shiwake, i.e. journal and all the necessary reports, except for filling the gensen choushu zeigaku (withholding tax amount) and the bank account detail on the kakutei shinkoku sho, the final return.\nI realized about the fact when the kampukin, the tax refund had not been deposited to my specified bank account until today. I immediately checked the copies of my document submitted to the tax office and realized my omission.\nHowever, you may want to know that you can claim the kampukin tax refund for five years since the 1st January next year of your desired accounting year ending on the 31st December. Usually, kampukin should be deposited in my bank account latest by the end of April.\nIn this case, though, I have already submitted gensen choshu hyo, withholding skip, at the time of kakutei shinkoku. So I called the tax office and sought their advice on how to go about my kampukin.\nTheir answers and responses were surprising.\nFirstly, tax officers whoever attended my call were very polite, attentive, and kind.

Instead, according to the law practiced in New York State criminal courts involving crimes such as Criminal Possession of a Weapon in the Second Degree, New York Penal Law 265.03, a loaded firearm is one that is capable of being loaded, for example, with bullets or ammunition in the same case.

It\u2019s often surprising, if you look back in time at how much things have actually changed.\nMany of us will remember those days in the past when things were very different. If you\u2019re old enough, cast your mind back fifteen or twenty years and think of the number of loan sharks that were operating in Botswana. Do you remember how they were charging up to 30% interest per month? Do you remember how they were completely ignoring the \u201cin duplum\u201d rule, the rule that says that when a debt is settled the interest charged cannot exceed the remaining capital amount? Do you remember how they were routinely taking people\u2019s ATM cards and sometimes even their Omang cards as insurance that they would repay their loans?

Many people have dating nightmare stories about people who would be described as extroverts. Likewise, many have warm precious memories of dating someone who was introverted. The human personality is so complex that simply allocating sociability as the key determining factor for dating worthiness is a mistake. That being said, if you are an introverted personality it is still important to know how to stand out from the crowd. After all, as many people who have dated introverts discover, once they get to know their inner qualities, they can be excellent partners.

All of the alternative currencies are negligible in terms of size and scope: electronic transactions using bitcoin worldwide amount to only 16% of the electronic transactions conducted in the Czech koruna, a currency used by just 10.5m people.\nA more fundamental issue is bitcoin's constantly changing purchasing power. Money is a means for paying and settling transactions, a unit of account and a store of value. Swift changes in purchasing power are the enemy of any good currency. If a currency is losing value, people want to get rid of it quickly. In contrast, if it is gaining value, they hoard it.\nThe key principle of bitcoin is that its supply will be fixed, which makes it inherently volatile. This is the antithesis of our elastic money system, which is based on the principle that to keep the purchasing power of money relatively constant the amount of money has to change flexibly over time. The monetary policy lesson of the late 19th and 20th centuries is that price stability matters. People may take it for granted but this is the most beneficial feature of money in its present form and the monetary policy behind it.

{"text": "When the ignition key is turned to the ON position, electricity flows from the ignition switch to the CHARGE light and then to the D+ terminal of the voltage regulator. (The CHARGE lamp internal resistance acts to limit the current and to give a visual indication that the lamp is OK). This small current then flows through the voltage regulator from the DF terminal on the voltage regulator to the DF terminal at the brush holder at the rotor, then into the rotor via the carbon brush and slip ring. It then flows out the rotor via the other brush and slip ring to ground. This makes a complete electrical circuit, and the small amount of current flowing through the rotor induces a small magnetic field in the rotor. The CHARGE light will be brightly lit.\nWhen the engine is started and the rotor is rotating the rotor magnetic field is transformed into AC in the non-moving stator windings. Six small diodes on the diode board change a small amount of the produced electricity into DC, and this is then supplied back to the voltage regulator. As engine RPM increase to the point that the small diodes can supply 12V to the regulator, it reaches the point where the voltage regulator has 12v on both sides. The voltage drop across the voltage regulator becomes zero and the CHARGE light will extinguish.The small diodes continue to produce more current as engine RPM increase and fully power the rotor . From this point on the system no longer requires excitation and it continues to supply itself."}

For the evil Empire\u2019s various TIE models this means, of course, those guys in the black variant of the standard Stormtrooper armour. We saw them briefly in all three original movies, I believe. And the robot mode of this toy nicely manages to depict these evil pilots.\nOf course they aren\u2019t entirely black, as the bluish-grey parts of the TIE bomber have to go somewhere and there are those two big wing panels. These go onto the arms of the robot, looking nicely like big shields, and as the robot is very nicely articulated, he can bring them to bear in a number of cool poses. The look and colours of the robot actually remind me of Movie Blackout, which certainly isn\u2019t a bad thing.\nWhat else? The TIE Bomber Pilot comes with a missile launcher for a hand weapon, a simple gun launching a black missile. His big lower legs give him a solid stance and articulation is, as I mentioned already, very nice.

{"text": "Can Medical Marijuana Actually Assist With Rough Hangovers?\nSpending a night out with your friends is always a good time, but the morning after is not always a bed of roses. Too often, going hard at the club or the bar will result in a massive headache and upset stomach the next day. However, what if there was a way to reduce the effects of a hangover? While there are plenty of products on the market today, one might be the best of them all: medical cannabis. Let\u2019s see what discoveries are being made about this potential cure.\nBefore we can decide if weed can cure this ailment, we first have to understand how it works. After a hard night of drinking, your body requires two things to feel refreshed and get back to normal. First, you need to rehydrate as alcohol saps your body of water. Second, you have to flush all of the toxic chemicals out of your system. Until both of those things happen, you won\u2019t be rid of your hangover.\nWell, it should be clear that smoking a joint will not rehydrate your cells, nor will it expunge the alcohol from your body. So why would it ever be considered a hangover cure? Well, two reasons. First, it helps you feel better, so you are not in as much pain (particularly in your head). Second, it can alleviate your nausea and help you eat and drink. Since water is necessary to beat your hangover, this can be a game changer.\nIf you want the ultimate in convenience, then you should look into getting your weed delivered.

{"text": "Toulouse is situated in the Haute-Garonne department of the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es region of France, about 180 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, about 90 miles from the Mediterranean, and 360 miles from Paris. With a population of over 400,000 in the city itself and over 1.2 million in the metropolitan area, Toulouse is both the fourth-largest city and the fourth-largest metropolitan area in France, after Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. Toulouse is perhaps most famous for its role in the French aeronautics industry: it is the site of the headquarters of airplane manufacturer Airbus and the Toulouse Space Center, one of two command centers for CNES (\u201cthe NASA of France\u201d) and the largest aerospace facility in Europe. Not surprisingly, Toulouse is also a university town, with several technology schools and research centers, as well as the world-renowned University of Toulouse, one of the oldest universities in the world. With about 125,000 students in residence, Toulouse boasts the third largest student population in France after Paris and Lyon. Based on my personal experience during that short weekend visit, I can attest to the fact that you can\u2019t swing a baguette in Toulouse without hitting a 19-year-old college student!\nThe history of Toulouse did not end in the 1200s, of course, but it was the end of Toulouse as a country independent of France. It\u2019s also the period of the city\u2019s rich history that was most evident (and most interesting) to me during my brief visit. For background on the more"}

With the heat of summer behind us and the tundra of winter still ahead, there are a lot of things to do in the District and the weather is often cooperative.

Most are free to view or attend and with such a variety, there\u2019s something for everyone. Located on the National Mall, you\u2019ll find the city\u2019s collection of Smithsonian museums including the National Museum of American History, National Museum of Natural History, National Air and Space Museum, National Museum of the American Indian, National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Gallery of Art. All of the museums are well worth your time, but you might want to pick one or two to prioritize depending on how long your stay is. Another popular museum in town, though not part of the Smithsonian Institute, is the Newseum. Located in close proximity to the National Mall, the Newseum explores history through the eyes of the press.\nMost of DC\u2019s national monuments are also located near the National Mall and can be seen via foot or by one of the many bus or trolley tours offered. If you want to check out all of the monuments the tour is your best bet.\nThe Capitol Visitors Center opened in 2008 and is serves as the welcome center to our nation\u2019s capitol building.

{"text": "There is actually a great deal of crossover between the two words and the items they represent, meaning the terms can be used interchangeably a lot of the time. This arises due to the different ways the words are used as nouns or verbs and, in relation to products such as screws, nails, nuts/bolts etc, difficulties arise unless the word \u2018fixing\u2019 is ONLY used as a verb.\nAs always, when there is confusion like this, the best place to head for is the dictionary to get a proper definition. But don\u2019t worry, we have done the research for you!\nFor example, if a joist is securely nailed into a joist hanger, with the use of extra straps for lateral restraint purposes, \u2018fixings\u2019 refers to the entire system, inclusive of all straps and connectors. The \u2018fasteners\u2019 in this context are the nails. A further example: if a rafter is attached to a wall plate using nails, the \u2018fastener\u2019 would be the nails and the \u2018fixing\u2019 the nails centres.\nIn most cases, uses the terms interchangeably is not a major issue and you will generally be understood either way. Our original question, about why we are not called BS Fasteners, is that we supply such a wide range of products that it makes more sense to refer to the entire systems we supply rather than individual items. Also, BS Fixings rolls off the tongue much nicer in our opinion!\nWhatever you need to fix, use our fasteners to fix it.

This isn't a job where you'll just start out at the top. You'll have to practice for years before you're scaling heights that grab the attention of professionals.\nTightrope, or tight-wire, walking is a career that involves training so much that your body begins to instinctively react to changing conditions, such as wind or slack in the rope, and you develop superb balance that keeps you on the wire no matter how conditions change. By starting to train when you're young, you can gain the skills and balance needed to get ahead of the competition and impress entertainment companies when you're looking for a job. Many circus-oriented camps offer summer programs that include training in tightrope walking. Future Stars offers a two-week circus arts camp for people up to age 16. Smirkus Camp offers summer camps for ages 5 to 18. The camp also can send residents to schools across the country to teach circus skills.\nFinding a mentor to train with is an important part of learning tightrope walking. Although you could theoretically learn from YouTube videos and the like, nothing beats one-on-one training.

When the emperor dies, a new one must be selected from among the Five Heirs. The Five Heirs are the heads of the five royal families (the most powerful families in the Amarr Empire) and descendants of the original members of the Privy Council. The Council was a staunch supporter of the Emperor during the turbulent times known as the Moral Reforms, a struggle between the Emperor and the Council of Apostles which took place 1500 years ago.

The whole pods can be added to dishes, or the seeds can be extracted and either added whole or ground. When using cardamom to flavour curries, lightly crush the whole pod and it to the dish, and remember to use the whole pods for garnishing to add that dash of green. But remember to use it sparingly, as a little cardamom goes a long way.\nCombating Cold and Flu: If you are suffering from a flu, black cardamoms form the perfect soother.

Sounds like a surefire energy drain, right?\nSurprisingly, the answer is no. According to Xcel Energy, by the time 2012 is over, Minnesotans will have used about 1% less energy than they did in 2011, with its not-as-hot summer and tepid winter months.\nSo, how is this possible? According to an article on TwinCities.com, Minnesotans are not only becoming more energy conscious, but more pocketbook conscious in this time of economic downturn.\nPeople are making changes to their homes by using energy-efficient products, adding insulation, and adjusting thermostats. They\u2019re also learning that doing these things save money in the long run, as does unplugging things not in use, not leaving lights on, and keeping heating and cooling system usage as low as possible.\nAccording to the same article, Xcel\u2019s energy plants have actually been able to decrease their energy production by 6% per customer, which is a gigantic step in the right direction.\nTo read the full article, visit TwinCities.com."}

Absolute monster.\nDARK FORCES, arguably the best track off Slam's debut album, gets the remix treatment here, and Claude Young is on the job for a harder mix, which doesn't differ greatly melodically, but messes around with the percussion some and adds an interesting interlude. Kenny Larkin also plays with the rhythms some while maintaining the original riff, though the track shifts into its own being 1/3 of the way through. With the b-sides, \"Sick Organ\" offers an off-kilter tech track with plenty of angular melodies to keep the ears intrigued, while \"Plastic Jazz\" goes on a shiny tech-house kick. Not much jazz, but plenty of Detroitian groove.\nOnce you have heard Dark Forces you won't forget it.

Extractors allow your car's engine to run more efficiently by allowing the exhaust gases to be pushed out more easily. This HONDA performance exhaust system upgrade will result in up to 15% better fuel economy, increased horsepower, increased torque and a cooler and cleaner running engine.\nThe combustion process of a petrol engine is never perfect. Dangerous gases, such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons will arise and it is the job of the catalytic converter to reduce these to safer emissions. These cat converters can fail by becoming clogged, or if the engine has bad exhaust valves or the plugs fail, causing unburned fuel to overheat the converter. Mettam's Mufflers can resolve these issues with your Armadale HONDA by replacing your damaged or clogged cat converter with a standard or hi-flow cat converter in under 1 hour.\nTwo examples of accessories that Mettam's Muffler's can provide to your Armadale HONDA are stainless steel mufflers and stainless steel tips and chrome ends.

The gathering will evaluate the potential role of satellite systems in achieving nationwide digital access. European attempts to date to achieve that goal will also be assessed.Bridging the digital divide is a challenge that has to be addressed for the future development of Europe's regions. For citizens isolated by natural obstacles, those living in scattered rural communities or on the outlying periphery of the European Union, there has been no commercially-viable solution to bring them online. Moreover, the arrival of ten new EU member countries will perhaps increase the current inequality of digital access.\nThe colloquium will address the question of: \"Can space-based infrastructures provide the most appropriate solution to narrow the gap?\" Terrestrial infrastructures, for example, are affected by population density or low-level economic activity. Satellite systems, however, guarantee uniform coverage over a given area; within this area, all potential users enjoy the same access to services and the same quality of service. TV broadcasting is a practical illustration of this.\nIt is therefore important to determine if the satellite option can provide a technically appropriate response. Because most digitally-deprived localities tend also to be the least densely populated issues related to how this should be financed become highly relevant. Howe"}

Thanks to the company\u2019s busy bookkeepers, it found clever ways of actually getting a federal income tax rebate of $129 million, which essentially means Uncle Sam dropped a maraschino cherry on top of Amazon\u2019s massive cash slushie.\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon who once earned more on his lunch break than some countries earn in months, has been crowned the wealthiest person on the planet. Last year, his net worth smashed $150 billion \u2013 some $50 billion more than Microsoft\u2019s CEO runner-up Bill Gates.\nSo, as average Americans prepare for the annual ritual of mailing their tax returns by the April 15 deadline, many do so in the knowledge that they will owe Uncle Sam some money.

Does this person always seem to charm everyone despite their selfish tendencies? Chances are that you\u2019ve found yourself the victim of Narcissistic Hoovering.\nIf the term \u201choovering\u201d brings a vacuum cleaner to mind, then you\u2019re on the right track. The term \u2018hoovering\u2019 was coined after a popular brand of vacuum cleaner due to the nature of this psychological ploy mimicking the sucking action. While a common trait for narcissists, the tactic of \u201choovering\u201d is used by a number of personality types, particularly those with manipulative tendencies or a complete disregard for the disruption they cause in other\u2019s lives.\nWhile the cycle itself tends to be fairly common the tactic of \u201choovering\u201d can come into play once a discarding phase has occurred. Narcissists who struggle to find a new source of personal service from another individual and those that create a repetitive cycle through a select social group will often employ the hoovering tactic in order to lure another victim into their web of manipulation and destruction. Any time a narcissist begins to feel the need, he or she can and will often return to previous sources of narcissist supply in order to achieve their desires.\nNarcissists are, by nature, individuals with a higher presence of controlling tendencies.

In a series of follow-up experiments, they then split the roots of each plant between two pots that had equal average nutrient concentrations, but where one pot had a constant level and the other a variable level, asking whether plants would \u2018prefer\u2019 to grow more roots in one or the other.\nThis is because when the average nutrient level is below what is required for the plant to thrive, the variable option at least offers the chance to \u2018gamble\u2019 on a run of good luck. On the other hand, when average conditions are good, it makes sense to take the safe option.\nCo-author Professor Alex Kacelnik, of the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, said: \u2018To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of an adaptive response to risk in an organism without a nervous system.

Islamophobia is \"unfounded hostility towards Muslims, and therefore fear or dislike of all or most Muslims.\" The term was coined in 1991 about Muslims in the United Kingdom (England) in particular and Europe in general, and was based on the more common \"xenophobia\" framework (i.e. creating fear of others). For more, see the 1991 Runnymede Trust Report.\nIslam is the world's second largest religion. Muslims make up 23% of the world's population.

Many of these evidence-based practices, promising studies, and groundbreaking programs are never adopted outside their test facilities. Many fail to work or fall short of expectations when implemented elsewhere. And it\u2019s often difficult to get buy-in from healthcare staff and leadership on a new way of doing things.\nPSMJ spoke with Craig Deao, MHA, senior leader at Studer Group, about how to tell whether a new innovation can work at your facility and how to successfully implement it.\nQ: Reading the news every day makes it seem like the healthcare field abounds with \u201cproven methods\u201d and \u201cevidence-based\u201d innovations that could improve healthcare. Is that the reality?\nAnd [17 years] is just the median, so there\u2019s still half the market that hasn\u2019t adopted the practice.

They offer the greatest number of Ferrari ads on each of these markets. Replicas of Ferrari, wrecked cars, imports from the United States ... are removed from the published figures, as any questionable deals at extremely low or high prices, which would not be representative of the market and distord the data. The minimum and maximum rates are present only for information. It is the median price in bold which is representative of the market. This is thes price asked in the ads, not the actual sales prices, which are not known but inevitably lower. Changes in prices are representative of market trends.\nWhile prices for the Ferrari 360 Modena followed a logical decline since 2010 (latest model), their rates have increased since one year and a half. This increase was global on Ferrari and vintage cars. The rates have not doubled as for other models, but they are still 22% higher than in 2014.\nYou may notice that some people attempt rates never seen before, for instance 159,990 euros requested for a Ferrari 360 Spider.

{"text": "The MCU is a funny beast. Despite the titling, it's now become pretty difficult to isolate any single film as standalone - in my view they should have just stopped messing around and named this film MCU 13. That's not to say the labouring of the MCU is a bad thing; on the contrary really since Civil War really is one of the best film to have come out of the franchise so far. And yes, that includes Assemble.\nDespite being the easiest way to explain, it would be unfair to directly compare it to that the lynch pin movie of 2012. CW is mature, grown up, relying less on gimmicks and set pieces. There's more to the film than just the action and fan service. And yes, it does make you think (well, kind of). All of the characters come into their own (another reason why calling this a Captain America film could be seen as odd), and have been given more than enough potential to grow even more.\nThe downsides include some shoddy filming, especially during the fight scenes. Overall though the movie does get away with it, as it injects the blue, red and gold blurs into your eyeballs.\nI won't go on because it'll just end up being gush. Needless to say Civil War is a great film and very much recommended."}

Most recently, the exchange rate manipulation of the Turkish lira is simply the latest in a long list of Washington-led aggression directed at Turkey.\nHowever, Ankara is not the only target of the Trump administration. European countries are also being threatened by Trump's controversial decisions and actions. While clearly the Turkish economy is currently the most apparent target, Turkey's main opposition party, the Republican People's Party (CHP), has somehow misinterpreted the situation. Unfortunately, CHP Chairman Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu has not hesitated to position himself against Ankara, claiming the government is the reason for the current crisis. Although the country is used to such irrational reactions from him whenever a crisis occurs, K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu's statements on the standoff, in this instance between Turkey and the United States, are so shocking that even his party's own base cannot accept them.\nThis is nothing new.

The only support provided by the dolphins was a spiritual one. Dorina says she has always been aware of the dangers posed by a dolphin assisted birth, especially in the ocean, and has been upset by all the negative feedback she has gotten as a result of this FALSE story spreading on the internet.

The experiments include a predesigned W8x10 beam with limited existing damage subject to a realistic parametric fire curve with a decay phase, and two W12x26 beams \u2013 one bare steel and one insulated with a spray on fire resistant material - designed and tested with an E119 standard fire curve. The complete design and record of the tests are provided, including data on specimen temperatures and deflections.SAFIR 2016 was used to model the systems thermal and structural behavior at various levels of intensity. 2D beam, 3D beam, and 3D shell models were created to test the level of accuracy and predictability of the models. The 2D structural models were proven to be incapable of predicting accurate behavior of a composite system. MATLAB 2015 was used to verify temperature predictions using a three lumped mass calculation approach, and was shown to equal or exceed the performance of the thermal finite element models.A parametric study was conducted using the results from the two W12x26 test beams.

{"text": "The mortgage market this past week resulted in higher interest rates for those looking for new homes or refinancing their existing homes. The reasons behind this are pure speculation: The Federal Reserve may stop the bond buying program because new unemployment claims hit a low not seen in six years.\nFor several weeks, there has been ongoing speculation the Fed would stop the QE program they have been running to keep interest rates low. However, the markets are getting increasingly nervous as economic news continues to be positive. However, it is important to note that there is a significant chance the bond buying program will most likely not come to a screeching halt. Instead, the Fed will most likely taper this program off to ensure the markets do not over-react (much like what they are doing now).\nNone of these reports, outside of perhaps the Fed minutes, will drive the market too much in one direction or another. However, there is little doubt that as more economic data comes in that is positive, we will continue to see rates rising.\nMany who are refinancing an existing property or financing a new home often struggle with whether or not to lock in their interest rates at the time of their application. Keep in mind that locking a rate in often means paying extra points or paying a small fee upfront. However, the fee that you might incur could be worthwhile over the life of your loan.\nWhether you are purchasing a home or you are consider a refinance on your existing home, t"}

But their secret may be utterly spoiled by a comedic cow named Otis (voiced by Kevin James). Nor do things improve when this ambitious moo-ver and shaker tries to lead the rest of the herd.\nMale cows with udders are ridiculous\u2014\u201cudder\"ly ridiculous. But once you get past this anatomical error, Barnyard: The Original Party Animals has its moments of farmyard fun.\nIt\u2019s a classic case of coming out to play while the farmer is away. Turning the old red barn into a pool hall with poker, gambling, a dance floor and a bar, these animals are all about having a good time. Luckily, at least a couple of the beasts have the sense to keep any eye out for the farmer\u2019s return.\nWatching over the menagerie of critters is Ben the Bovine (voice by Sam Elliot) and Miles the mule (voice by Danny Glover). While the cows, chickens, pigs and horses whoop it up in the shed, Ben stands as a sentinel, protecting them from an encroaching pack of hungry coyotes led by Dag (voice by David Koechner).\nAlthough he tries to groom his rebellious and irresponsible son to some day take over the role, Otis (voice by Kevin James) is reluctant to give up his wild ways. Joyriding in a stolen car with open bottles of milk (that mimic the effects of beer), the younger cow and his gang of buddies (voices by S.

{"text": "How do your eating habits impact your heart health?\nYour weight, what you eat, and your exercise habits all have a significant impact on heart health. Losing just 3-5% of body weight can result in significant metabolic improvements, reduced long-term health risks, and better overall quality of life. Therefore, even small changes are worthwhile in improving your overall health and wellness. Weight loss doesn\u2019t have to be \"all-or-nothing.\" Any improvement is significant!\nA great place to start is keeping an eye on what you eat. The four terms we always hear in relation to nutrition are fiber, fat, calories, and carbs. How do these all impact heart health? Centra's Medical Bariatrician Dr. Mike Jones and Amy Casagrande, Centra's Bariatric Dietitian, provide some tips for insight.\nFiber is great for heart health because it can bind with bad cholesterol and remove it from the body. Foods high in dietary fiber include whole grains, vegetables, and fruit. To increase your fiber intake from foods, include more plant-based sources of protein such as beans and peas, choose whole-grains whenever possible and eat a diet rich in non-starchy vegetables and fruits.\nFat often gets a lot of attention in heart-healthy eating plans, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to eliminate it. Focus on sources of unsaturated fats instead, such as olive and vegetable oil, nuts and seeds, avocados and fatty fish.\nWhen choosing carbohydrate-rich foods, focus on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dair"}

Being exercise avoiders and salad dodgers for quite some time now, it\u2019s a title which we went into without really knowing what to expect, but we\u2019ve come away fairly impressed and will definitely be sinking some more time into it very soon.\nYou may be imagining (as we were) that this title would be mostly about mashing your controller in a constant and concerted effort to retain the number one spot and hurtle your way through the stages of Le Tour, but this couldn\u2019t be further form the game we\u2019re presented with. Instead, fine strategy management is required for both your own stamina and your team\u2019s efforts as well, to ensure a good finish for you at the end of each stage.\nIt\u2019s a lot more in depth than we thought it would be, and for non-cycling enthusiasts, we\u2019ve liked the detail and strategy which has been put into this, as well as the relaxing nature of the ride. While we\u2019ve had an enjoyable (if sometimes a little baffling) experience, We imagine that this will be a hit for fans of the sport.\nSatisfaction: 7/10: It\u2019s not a super high score but it\u2019s definitely one we\u2019ve enjoyed playing. While there\u2019s nothing outstanding for us, we imagine that fans of Le tour or cycling in general may get a lot more out of the game though, and at \u00a339.99, or 49.99 for the US and Europe, it\u2019s not pricing itself o"}

Could you imagine?\nOkay, that was for non-millennials who love to mock the younger generation. Now, let\u2019s flip the script, because like it or not, millennials themselves read comments like that, and if you or your company ignore them or mock them, you will not be relevant much longer. The millennial cohort is the largest in American history, and if they aren\u2019t important for your business yet, they soon will be.\nIt\u2019s not like we haven\u2019t been there.
