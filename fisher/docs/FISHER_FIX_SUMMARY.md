# Fisher EMA Computation Fix Summary

## Problem
The Fisher information computation was failing with the warning:
```
✓ Direct Fisher computed for 'task1'
⚠️ Fisher computed but no data found for 'task1'
✓ Direct Fisher computed for 'task2'
⚠️ Fisher computed but no data found for 'task2'
⚠️ No Fisher EMA data computed for any task
```

## Root Cause
1. **Model parameters had `requires_grad=False`**: When models are loaded from pretrained weights, PyTorch sets `requires_grad=False` by default
2. **No gradients computed**: During `loss.backward()`, no gradients were computed because parameters didn't require gradients
3. **Empty Fisher dictionary**: Since all `param.grad` values were `None`, no Fisher values were stored
4. **Validation failed**: The validation check found no matching keys in `bombshell.fisher_ema`

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enable Gradients Before Fisher Computation
**File**: `unified_model_analysis.py` (line 5832-5845)
- Store original gradient requirements
- Enable gradients for all parameters before Fisher computation
- Log how many parameters were enabled

### 2. Restore Original Gradient State
**File**: `unified_model_analysis.py` (lines 5924-5926, 6090-6095)
- Restore original gradient requirements after Fisher computation
- Handle both early returns and normal completion

### 3. Add Safety Checks
**File**: `fisher_collector.py` (lines 159-165, 212-217)
- Check if loss requires gradients before calling backward()
- Warn if no gradients are found for any parameters
- Return empty dict gracefully when gradients are disabled

## Verification
The fix was verified with test scripts that confirm:
- Fisher values are now computed successfully when gradients are enabled
- Proper warnings are shown when gradients are disabled
- Keys are stored in the correct format: `task|param_name|group_type`
- Both task1 and task2 Fisher values are properly stored and accessible

## Impact
- Fisher-based metrics will now work correctly in the analysis pipeline
- Proper gradient state management prevents side effects
- Clear warnings help diagnose issues when models are frozen
