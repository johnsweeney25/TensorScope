# Fisher Overlap Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The `compute_fisher_overlap` metric was failing with the error:
```
unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'str' and 'str'
```

## Root Cause
When Fisher EMA data is not available, `get_fisher_pruning_masks` returns an error dictionary with an 'error' key. However, this error dictionary was being passed directly to `compute_fisher_overlap`, which expected tensor dictionaries and tried to use bitwise operators (`&` and `|`) on what it assumed were boolean tensors.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. unified_model_analysis.py (Lines 2073-2099)
Added comprehensive validation in the standalone metric execution path:
- Check if masks are valid dictionaries
- Verify no 'error' key exists in masks
- Ensure all values are torch.Tensor objects
- Provide detailed error messages when validation fails

### 2. unified_model_analysis.py (Lines 4672-4703)
Added validation in the batch Fisher analysis section:
- Validate masks before attempting overlap computation
- Handle invalid masks gracefully with informative logging
- Store error information in results when masks are invalid
- Only compute overlap when both masks are valid

### 3. BombshellMetrics.py (Lines 5612-5667)
Enhanced `compute_fisher_overlap` method with robust type checking:
- Validate input types are dictionaries
- Check for and handle error dictionaries
- Verify all values are torch.Tensor objects
- Convert tensors to boolean type for bitwise operations
- Return informative error messages instead of crashing

## Testing
The fixes have been tested and confirmed to handle:
- Error dictionaries from failed Fisher computations
- Invalid types being passed as masks
- Proper tensor validation and boolean conversion
- Graceful error reporting with detailed messages

## Result
The `compute_fisher_overlap` metric now fails gracefully with informative error messages instead of crashing, making it easier to diagnose when Fisher EMA data is not available.
