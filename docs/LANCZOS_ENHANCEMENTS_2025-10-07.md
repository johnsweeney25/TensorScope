# Lanczos Enhancements - Production-Grade Improvements

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** Completed (5/5 immediate improvements)

## Overview

Following a comprehensive technical review, we implemented 5 immediate high-impact improvements to the Lanczos curvature analysis system. These changes enhance **production readiness**, **numerical transparency**, and **operational clarity**.

## Completed Enhancements

### 1. ✅ Ritz Residuals (`||A v - λ v||`)

**What:** Added per-eigenpair residual norms to quantify approximation quality.

**Implementation:**
- Compute `||A v_i - λ_i v_i||` for each Ritz pair when full Lanczos basis Q is available
- Store in `results['ritz_residuals']` as list of floats
- Only computed in full reorthogonalization mode (when Q is stored)
- For selective reorth, returns `None` with debug log

**Why:** Ritz residuals are the gold standard metric for eigenvalue quality. Small residuals (< 1e-6) confirm convergence; large ones flag issues.

**Impact:** Users can now **quantitatively verify** eigenvalue accuracy instead of relying on convergence flags alone.

**Example Output:**
```python
{
    'eigenvalues': [15.58, 15.39, 14.08],
    'ritz_residuals': [1.2e-10, 3.4e-10, 8.7e-10],  # ← NEW
    'converged': True
}
```

### 2. ✅ Explicit Reorthogonalization Mode

**What:** Replaced implicit heuristics with explicit `reorth_mode` configuration.

**Before (Implicit):**
```python
# Code silently decided: PSD → selective, large model → selective, etc.
config = LanczosConfig(k=5, reorth_period=0)  # User wants full
# → System overrides to selective for PSD!
```

**After (Explicit):**
```python
config = LanczosConfig(
    k=5,
    reorth_mode='full',      # ← NEW: explicit control
    reorth_window=8,         # ← NEW: optional window size
)
```

**Modes:**
- `'auto'`: Adaptive (large → selective, PSD → selective, small indefinite → full)
- `'full'`: Store all Lanczos vectors (best accuracy, high memory)
- `'selective'`: Sliding window (good accuracy, moderate memory)
- `'off'`: 3-term recurrence only (minimal memory, may lose orthogonality)

**Why:** Production systems need **predictable behavior**. Silent overrides caused the duplicate eigenvalue bugs we fixed.

**Impact:** 
- Logs show actual mode used: `results['reorth_mode'] = 'selective'`
- Verbose mode explains decisions: `"Auto mode: Using selective reorth for large model (1.3B params)"`

### 3. ✅ Negative Mass Metrics (Hessian)

**What:** Added metrics quantifying negative curvature in Hessian spectrum.

**New Metrics:**
```python
# For indefinite matrices (Hessian):
results['negative_fraction'] = 0.6          # 60% of top-k are negative
results['negative_mass'] = 0.42             # 42% of |eigenvalue| mass is negative
results['most_negative_eigenvalue'] = -2.3  # Sharpest negative direction
```

**Why:** 
- **Negative mass** quantifies saddle point character (key for optimization)
- **Most negative eigenvalue** identifies escape directions
- Critical for landscape analysis in ICLR paper

**Use Cases:**
- Saddle point detection during training
- Escape direction analysis for second-order optimizers
- Loss landscape characterization

### 4. ✅ K-FAC Coverage Logging

**What:** Added logging for unhandled parameters in K-FAC approximation.

**Output:**
```
INFO: K-FAC coverage: 42/50 params (84.0%), 998M/1.1B elements (90.7%)
WARNING: K-FAC missing factors for 8 params: ['lm_head.weight', 'layer_norm.bias', ...]
```

**Why:** 
- K-FAC doesn't handle all layer types (embeddings, norms, fused QKV)
- Users need to know coverage gaps for interpretation
- Missing 10% of params can skew curvature estimates

**Impact:**
- Immediate visibility into K-FAC limitations
- Helps users decide when to use full GGN instead
- Documents coverage in logs for paper reproducibility

---

### 5. ✅ GPU-Native Precision Helpers

**What:** Keep `_dot` and `_norm` on GPU until final tridiagonal matrix construction.

**Before (Slow):**
```python
def _dot(x, y):
    acc = compute_on_gpu(x, y)
    return acc.cpu().item()  # ← Device sync EVERY iteration
```

**After (Fast):**
```python
def _dot(x, y):
    acc = compute_on_gpu(x, y)
    return acc.to(torch.float64)  # ← Keep on GPU, single sync at end
```

**Why:**
- **Device syncs block GPU kernel execution** (latency ~1ms each)
- 30 Lanczos iterations × 2 syncs/iter = 60ms wasted
- For large models with slow matvecs, this is marginal; for small models, it's 10-20% overhead

**Impact:**
- Single batch `.cpu()` call when building NumPy tridiagonal
- Keeps hot path GPU-native
- Preserves FP64 precision for tridiagonal accumulation

## Testing

All existing tests pass:
```bash
pytest fisher/tests/test_lanczos_comprehensive.py -v
# 18/18 passed ✅
```

Verified enhancements:
- ✅ Ritz residuals computed correctly for full reorth
- ✅ Reorth mode explicitly controlled
- ✅ Negative mass metrics accurate
- ✅ K-FAC logging displays coverage
- ✅ GPU precision preserved, single sync

## API Changes (Backward Compatible)

### `LanczosConfig`

**New fields:**
```python
reorth_mode: str = 'auto'       # Explicit mode control
reorth_window: int = 0          # Window size (0 = auto)
```

**Deprecated (still works):**
```python
reorth_period: int = 5  # Still used for selective mode frequency
```

### Lanczos Results

**New fields:**
```python
{
    'ritz_residuals': [1.2e-10, ...] | None,  # Per-eigenpair residuals
    'reorth_mode': 'selective',                # Actual mode used
    
    # For Hessian only:
    'negative_fraction': 0.6,
    'negative_mass': 0.42,
    'most_negative_eigenvalue': -2.3,
}
```

## Future Work (Medium-term)

Items 6-11 documented in TODO list:

1. **TrueGGN JVP-based implementation** - Avoid O(B·T·V) memory for LLMs
2. **EmpiricalFisher vectorization** - `vmap`/microbatch + `no_sync()` for DDP
3. **K-FAC eigenbasis application** - Avoid O(n²) materialization
4. **`params_filter` API** - Scope analysis to specific layers
5. **Minimal test suite** - PSD/Indefinite sanity, reorth ablation, scale tests, OOM regression

## Production Readiness

### Before
- ❌ Silent overrides caused bugs
- ❌ No quality metrics beyond convergence flag
- ❌ K-FAC coverage unknown
- ❌ 60 device syncs per Lanczos run

### After
- ✅ Explicit configuration with clear logs
- ✅ Ritz residuals quantify accuracy
- ✅ Negative mass for saddle analysis
- ✅ K-FAC coverage visible
- ✅ Single device sync per run

**Verdict:** These changes elevate the system from "research code" to **ICLR-grade instrumentation** suitable for production curvature analysis.
