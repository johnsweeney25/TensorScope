# Fisher Information: MDL Diagnostic vs Production Implementation

## Overview

TensorScope includes two Fisher Information implementations serving different purposes:

1. **MDL's Fisher Diagnostic** (`mdl_complexity_proper.py`) - Simple diagnostic, NOT part of MDL
2. **Production Fisher** (`/fisher/core/`) - Full-featured implementation for optimization and analysis

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. MDL's Fisher Diagnostic

**Purpose**: Diagnostic metric showing parameter sensitivity, explicitly NOT part of MDL calculation.

**Implementation**:
```python
def compute_fisher_diagnostic_bits(self, model, data_loader, max_batches=100):
    """
    Compute Fisher Information diagnostic (NOT a proper MDL penalty).

    Returns 0.5 * log det(F), which appears in asymptotic MDL but needs
    additional terms (k/2 * log n - log p(θ)) to be a valid codelength.
    """
    # Simple diagonal approximation
    fisher_diag = compute_diagonal_fisher(model, data_loader)
    return {
        'fisher_diagnostic_bits': 0.5 * log|F| / log(2),
        'note': 'This is diagnostic only, not MDL!'
    }
```

**Characteristics**:
- **Algorithm**: Simple gradient² accumulation
- **Storage**: Diagonal only (O(n) memory)
- **Averaging**: Batch-weighted (fixed in latest version)
- **Output**: Single scalar (log determinant)
- **Use case**: Optional diagnostic for researchers

### 2. Production Fisher (`/fisher/core/`)

**Purpose**: Core framework component for optimization, pruning, and task interference analysis.

**Key Components**:

#### a. `fisher_collector_advanced.py`
```python
class AdvancedFisherCollector:
    """Unbiased Fisher with Welford's algorithm."""

    def collect_fisher(self, model, dataloader):
        # Welford's online algorithm for numerical stability
        # Eliminates EMA bias where early batches contribute <10%
        # Tracks variance for confidence intervals
```

**Features**:
- **Welford's algorithm**: Numerically stable, unbiased accumulation
- **Variance tracking**: Confidence intervals on Fisher estimates
- **Memory management**: Block-diagonal approximations for large models
- **Cross-task analysis**: Detect sample-level conflicts

#### b. `cross_task_conflict_detector.py`
```python
class CrossTaskConflictDetector:
    """Identify specific samples causing task interference."""

    def detect_conflicts(self, fisher_task1, fisher_task2):
        # Statistical significance testing with p-values
        # Effect size calculation (Cohen's d)
        # Multiple testing correction (Bonferroni/FDR)
```

**Novel Contribution**: First implementation to identify specific conflicting samples between tasks.

#### c. `fisher_lanczos_unified.py`
```python
def compute_fisher_eigenvalues_lanczos(model, dataloader, k=10):
    """Efficient eigenvalue computation without full matrix."""
    # Selective reorthogonalization
    # Saves ~48GB for 1.5B parameter models
    # Returns top-k eigenvalues/eigenvectors
```

**Memory Optimization**: Lanczos with selective reorthogonalization for spectrum analysis.

## Key Differences

| Aspect | MDL Diagnostic | Production Fisher |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Purpose** | Show parameter sensitivity | Enable optimization/analysis |
| **Part of MDL?** | NO (explicitly warned) | N/A |
| **Algorithm** | Basic grad² | Welford's unbiased |
| **Memory** | O(n) diagonal | O(n) to O(n²) configurable |
| **Storage** | In-memory | CPU/GPU with fp16 option |
| **Averaging** | Batch-weighted | Sample-exact with variance |
| **Output** | Scalar log|F| | Full matrix/diagonal/spectrum |
| **Features** | None | Cross-task, eigenvalues, pruning |
| **Accuracy** | Basic approximation | High precision with CI |
| **Speed** | Fast (~5s) | Slower but configurable |

## Mathematical Relationship

### In Asymptotic MDL Theory
The full MDL with Fisher (rarely used in practice):
```
MDL_asymptotic = (k/2)log(n) - log p(θ̂) + 0.5*log|F(θ̂)| + L(D|θ̂)
```

Where:
- `k` = number of parameters
- `n` = number of samples
- `p(θ̂)` = prior probability of parameters
- `F(θ̂)` = Fisher Information Matrix
- `L(D|θ̂)` = negative log-likelihood

### In Our Implementation

**MDL (two-part code)**:
```
MDL = L(architecture) + L(quantized_params) + L(D|M)
```
- **No Fisher term** in actual MDL calculation
- Fisher diagnostic provided separately for research

**Production Fisher** (used in unified_model_analysis):
```python
# Phase 5: Cross-task conflict detection
fisher_info = AdvancedFisherCollector.collect(model, dataloader)
conflicts = CrossTaskConflictDetector.detect(fisher_info)
```

## When to Use Which?

### Use MDL's Fisher Diagnostic When:
- You want a quick parameter sensitivity metric
- You're comparing MDL implementations
- You need the theoretical Fisher term for research
- Memory is extremely limited

### Use Production Fisher When:
- Optimizing models (natural gradient, K-FAC)
- Detecting task interference
- Pruning decisions (Fisher-based importance)
- Computing spectrum/eigenvalues
- Need confidence intervals
- Cross-task transfer learning

## Integration in Unified Analysis

In `unified_model_analysis.py`:

```python
# Production Fisher runs in Phase 5
context.fisher_info = AdvancedFisherCollector.collect(...)

# MDL runs as separate metric (includes optional diagnostic)
mdl_results = mdl.compute_mdl_complexity(model, data_loader)
# mdl_results includes proper MDL (no Fisher)
# Can optionally call compute_fisher_diagnostic_bits() for diagnostic

# Many metrics use production Fisher:
- compute_fisher_importance()
- compute_fisher_weighted_damage()
- detect_cross_task_conflicts()
- compute_fisher_overlap()
```

## Implementation Quality

### MDL Diagnostic
- ✅ Clearly marked as NOT MDL
- ✅ Simple, correct for its purpose
- ✅ Fixed device/dtype issues
- ✅ Proper batch weighting

### Production Fisher
- ✅ Unbiased (Welford's algorithm)
- ✅ Memory efficient (block-diagonal)
- ✅ Statistically rigorous (p-values, CI)
- ✅ Novel contributions (cross-task conflicts)
- ✅ Tested at scale (7B models)

## Summary

- **MDL's Fisher**: A simple diagnostic showing parameter sensitivity, explicitly NOT part of MDL calculation
- **Production Fisher**: Sophisticated framework component with multiple novel contributions
- **No overlap**: They serve completely different purposes
- **Both correct**: Each implementation is appropriate for its use case

The MDL implementation correctly uses the two-part code without Fisher, while providing the diagnostic for researchers who want to see the theoretical Fisher term. The production Fisher enables advanced optimization and analysis throughout the framework.
