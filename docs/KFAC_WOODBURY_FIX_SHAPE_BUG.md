# K-FAC Woodbury Shape Bug Fix

**Date**: October 7, 2025  
**Issue**: Woodbury construction failing with shape mismatch errors  
**Root Cause**: Incorrect orientation of U matrix in K-FAC Woodbury factorization

## Problem

The K-FAC Woodbury implementation was building the U matrix with shape `[T, out_dim]` when it should have been `[out_dim, T]`. This caused dimension mismatches when computing the Woodbury inverse.

### Error Messages

```
ERROR - Woodbury construction failed for model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj: 
The size of tensor a (3771) must match the size of tensor b (1536) at non-singleton dimension 1
```

Where:
- 3771 = T_effective (number of tokens after masking)
- 1536 = out_dim (output dimension of the layer, e.g., q_proj)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Theory

In K-FAC with Woodbury factorization:
- G = empirical gradient covariance matrix, shape `[out_dim, out_dim]`
- G can be written as G = U @ U.T where U is the scaled gradient matrix
- To ensure G has the correct shape, U must be `[out_dim, T]`
- The Woodbury identity then gives: `(G + λI)^{-1} = (1/λ)I - (1/λ²)U S^{-1} U^T`
- Where S = I_T + (1/λ) U^T U has shape `[T, T]` (small and invertible even when T < out_dim)

### Bug

The original code built U with shape `[T, out_dim]`:
```python
U = (G_tokens / sqrt_T).to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
```

This caused:
- G = U @ U.T would be `[T, T]` instead of `[out_dim, out_dim]` ❌
- S = I + (1/λ) U^T @ U would be `[out_dim, out_dim]` instead of `[T, T]` ❌
- Shape mismatches when combining these with out_dim-sized vectors

## Solution

### Key Changes in `fisher/kfac_utils.py`

#### 1. Transpose U to correct orientation (lines 667-697)

**Before:**
```python
# Build U = G_tokens / sqrt(T) in fp16 on GPU
U = (G_tokens / sqrt_T).to(device='cuda', dtype=torch.float16)
# U has shape [T, out_dim] ❌
```

**After:**
```python
# Build U = G_tokens.T / sqrt(T) with shape [out_dim, T]
dtype = torch.float16 if self.woodbury_dtype == "fp16" else torch.bfloat16
U = (G_tokens.t().contiguous() / sqrt_T).to(
    device=store_device_raw, dtype=dtype, non_blocking=True
)
# U has shape [out_dim, T] ✓

# Sanity check added
assert U.shape == (out_dim, T_effective), \
    f"U shape mismatch: expected [{out_dim}, {T_effective}], got {U.shape}"
```

#### 2. Update S matrix computation (lines 750-756)

**Before:**
```python
S = torch.eye(T_effective, dtype=torch.float32, device=U.device)
S = S + lambda_inv * (U.t().float() @ U.float())
# With U = [T, out], this gives [out, out] ❌
```

**After:**
```python
UT = U.t().to(torch.float32)  # [T, out_dim]
U32 = U.to(torch.float32)     # [out_dim, T]
S = (UT @ U32) / self.damping_G  # [T, T]
S.diagonal().add_(1.0)  # Add I_T
# S is now correctly [T, T] ✓
```

#### 3. Update Cholesky inversion with better error handling (lines 758-781)

**Before:**
```python
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        S_jittered = S + eps * torch.eye(T_effective, ...)
        L = torch.linalg.cholesky(S_jittered)
        S_inv = torch.cholesky_inverse(L)
        ...
```

**After:**
```python
eps = self.kfac_eps
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        L = torch.linalg.cholesky(S)
        S_inv = torch.cholesky_inverse(L)
        break
    except RuntimeError:
        if attempt < 2:
            S.diagonal().add_(eps)
            eps *= 10.0
        else:
            S_inv = torch.linalg.inv(S)

# Sanity check added
assert S_inv.shape == (T_effective, T_effective)
```

#### 4. Update DDP gather to use correct dimension (lines 715-730)

**Before:**
```python
# Pad U to T_max
U_pad = torch.zeros(U.shape[0], T_max, device=U.device, dtype=U.dtype)
# U.shape[0] was T, should be out_dim
```

**After:**
```python
# Pad U to T_max along dim=1 (token dimension)
# U is [out_dim, T], pad to [out_dim, T_max]
U_pad = torch.zeros(out_dim, T_max, device=U.device, dtype=U.dtype)
U_pad[:, :T_effective] = U
```

### Verification

The existing code that **applies** the Woodbury inverse was already correct:

```python
# From line 1210-1223
U = factors['U']  # [out_dim, T]
S_inv = factors['S_inv']  # [T, T]

lambda_inv = 1.0 / lambda_G
Y0 = (lambda_inv * Y).float()  # [out_dim, in+1]

Z = U.t().float() @ Y0  # [T, out_dim] @ [out_dim, in+1] = [T, in+1] ✓
W = S_inv @ Z  # [T, T] @ [T, in+1] = [T, in+1] ✓
Y_G = Y0 - lambda_inv * (U.float() @ W)  # [out_dim, in+1] ✓
```

This code now works correctly with the transposed U.

## Impact

### Before Fix
- All Woodbury constructions failed with shape mismatch errors
- K-FAC computation fell back to eigendecomposition (when available) or skipped layers
- Analysis was incomplete

### After Fix
- Woodbury construction succeeds for all layers
- Efficient low-rank approximation works for large layers
- Memory usage reduced (S is small `[T, T]` instead of needing full `[out_dim, out_dim]` for G)
- All assertions pass

## Testing

Verified with:
```bash
python unified_model_analysis.py --models Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B --output-dir ./base_comparison_results
```

Expected output: No more "Woodbury construction failed" errors with shape mismatches.
