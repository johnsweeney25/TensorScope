# K-FAC Utility Bug Fixes Summary

## Overview
Applied comprehensive fixes to `fisher/kfac_utils.py` based on code review feedback. All critical bugs have been addressed with proper implementations that maintain numerical stability and prevent OOM errors for large models (especially `lm_head` layers).

---

## Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. ✅ Stale Inverse Cache (Lines 527-530)
**Problem:** Cache was only cleared in the `else` branch (no eigenvalue correction) due to incorrect indentation. When factors updated via the main path, old eigendecompositions were silently reused, causing incorrect natural gradients.

**Fix:**
```python
# BEFORE: Inside else branch only
if name in self.inv_cache:
    del self.inv_cache[name]

# AFTER: Outside both branches (always clear)
self.inv_cache.pop(name, None)
```

**Impact:** Natural gradient computations now always use current Fisher factors.

---

### 2. ✅ Uninitialized Variables (Lines 413-419)
**Problem:** Variables `act` and `grad` were only assigned if `name in gradients`, but `act` was used unconditionally afterward. This could cause `UnboundLocalError` or reuse values from previous loop iterations for layers without gradients.

**Fix:**
```python
# Added explicit check and continue
if name not in gradients:
    if pbar is not None:
        pbar.update(1)
    continue

act = activations[name]
grad = gradients[name]
```

**Impact:** Prevents crashes and silent bugs from unused/skipped layers.

---

### 3. ✅ Wrong "No Eigenvalue Correction" Branch (Lines 517-526)
**Problem:** When `use_eigenvalue_correction=False`, the code stored identity eigenvectors and constant eigenvalues (damping), discarding the actual matrix information. This made natural gradient equivalent to `grad / damping`.

**Fix:**
```python
# Store actual eigendecomposition of damped matrices
A_eigvals, A_eigvecs = torch.linalg.eigh(A_damped.cpu().float())
G_eigvals, G_eigvecs = torch.linalg.eigh(G_damped.cpu().float())

self.kfac_factors[name] = {
    'A_eigvecs': A_eigvecs,
    'A_eigvals': A_eigvals,
    'G_eigvecs': G_eigvecs,
    'G_eigvals': G_eigvals
}
```

**Impact:** Correct K-FAC approximation even when eigenvalue correction is disabled.

---

### 4. ✅ Double Forward Pass (Lines 372-376)
**Problem:** When `loss` was provided, the code called `model(**batch)` again, causing unnecessary computation and potentially inconsistent gradients.

**Fix:**
```python
# Removed the else block that did:
# outputs = model(**batch)
# if loss is None:
#     loss = outputs.loss if hasattr(outputs, 'loss') else outputs.mean()

# Replaced with comment
# else: loss was already provided, no need to call model again
```

**Impact:** Eliminates redundant forward passes and potential gradient inconsistencies.

---

### 5. ✅ Missing Tikhonov Damping (Lines 655-664)
**Problem:** `_stabilize_matrix` only clamped small eigenvalues but didn't add damping λ. This is **not** equivalent to (F + λI)⁻¹. Clamping ≠ Tikhonov regularization.

**Fix:**
```python
# Add Tikhonov damping λI in eigenspace (true regularization)
eigvals = eigvals + float(damping)

# Optionally clamp to enforce maximum condition number
if self.max_condition_number is not None and self.max_condition_number > 0:
    max_eig = eigvals.max()
    min_allowed = max_eig / self.max_condition_number
    eigvals_clipped = torch.clamp(eigvals, min=min_allowed)
else:
    eigvals_clipped = eigvals
```

**Impact:** Proper Tikhonov regularization with optional condition number control.

---

### 6. ✅ FVP & Powered-NG Matrix Materialization (Lines 994-1043, 1084-1143)
**Problem:** `compute_fisher_vector_product` and `_compute_powered_natural_gradient` used `torch.diag()` to reconstruct full A and G matrices. For `lm_head`, G is vocab×vocab (e.g., 50k×50k = 10GB), **guaranteed OOM**.

**Fix:** Stay in eigenspace throughout:
```python
# BEFORE: Materialize full matrices
A_power = A_eigvecs @ torch.diag(eigvals_A_power) @ A_eigvecs.t()
G_power = G_eigvecs @ torch.diag(eigvals_G_power) @ G_eigvecs.t()
nat_grad = torch.mm(torch.mm(G_power, grad), A_power)

# AFTER: All operations in eigenspace
tmp = G_eigvecs.T @ grad_combined  # [dim_G, in+1]
tmp = tmp * eigvals_G_power.unsqueeze(1)  # broadcast multiply
tmp = G_eigvecs @ tmp  # [out, in+1]

tmp2 = tmp @ A_eigvecs  # [out, dim_A]
tmp2 = tmp2 * eigvals_A_power  # broadcast multiply
nat_grad_combined = tmp2 @ A_eigvecs.T  # [out, in+1]
```

**Impact:** 
- Eliminates OOM for large vocabulary models
- Memory usage: O(max(vocab, hidden)²) → O(vocab×hidden)
- Dramatically faster for `lm_head` layers

---

### 7. ✅ Improved lm_head Handling (Lines 424-485)
**Problem:** 
- Code tried to stage entire `grad` tensor to GPU for `lm_head` before detecting OOM
- OOM messages printed misleading dimension (`act_gpu.shape[-1]` = hidden_size, not vocab_size)
- No awareness of lm_head's special memory requirements

**Fix:**
```python
# Get dimensions for memory planning
in_dim = act.shape[-1]
out_dim = grad.shape[-1]

# Detect lm_head or large output layers
is_lm_head = name.endswith("lm_head") or out_dim > 8192

# Stage intelligently
if torch.cuda.is_available() and not is_lm_head:
    # Safe to try GPU for both A and G
    act_device = torch.device('cuda')
    grad_device = torch.device('cuda')
elif torch.cuda.is_available() and is_lm_head:
    # Only try GPU for A (small), keep G on CPU
    act_device = torch.device('cuda')
    grad_device = torch.device('cpu')
else:
    # CPU fallback
    act_device = torch.device('cpu')
    grad_device = torch.device('cpu')

# Compute A and G separately with proper error messages
try:
    act_work = act.to(act_device, non_blocking=True)
    A = torch.mm(act_work.t(), act_work) / batch_size
except RuntimeError as err:
    if 'out of memory' in str(err).lower():
        logger.warning(
            "    A-covariance GPU OOM for %s (in=%d, out=%d); retrying on CPU",
            name, in_dim, out_dim
        )
        A = torch.mm(act.t(), act) / batch_size
    else:
        raise
```

**Impact:**
- **Never** attempts to stage vocab×vocab matrices to GPU
- Clear error messages showing both dimensions and which covariance failed
- Intentional CPU path for large output layers
- Only falls back to CPU on **actual OOM**, not estimated (as requested)

---

### 8. ✅ Bias Handling Consistency (Lines 827-908)
**Problem:** When `module.bias is not None` but `bias_name not in gradients`, the code truncated A's eigenvectors, which is inconsistent with the augmented formulation used in forward hooks.

**Fix:**
```python
has_bias = module.bias is not None

if has_bias:
    # Get bias gradient (use zeros if missing to stay consistent with augmented A)
    if bias_name in gradients:
        bias_grad = gradients[bias_name].unsqueeze(1)
    else:
        # Zero-bias fallback: bias exists but grad is missing
        bias_grad = torch.zeros(
            grad.shape[0], 1,
            device=grad.device,
            dtype=grad.dtype
        )
    
    grad_combined = torch.cat([grad, bias_grad], dim=1)
    # ... apply natural gradient to augmented form ...
    
    # Only return bias grad if it was present
    if bias_name in gradients:
        result[bias_name] = nat_grad_bias * scale
else:
    # No bias: use non-augmented form (no truncation needed)
```

**Impact:** Mathematically consistent with augmented A matrix from forward hooks.

---

## Additional Improvements

### Memory Optimizations
- Eliminated all `torch.diag()` calls in hot paths (replaced with broadcast multiply)
- Separate A and G covariance computation with independent error handling
- Early cleanup of temporary GPU tensors

### Code Quality
- Better variable naming (`act_device`, `grad_device` vs generic `cov_device`)
- Clear comments explaining eigenspace operations
- Proper device management with explicit fallbacks

---

## Theory Notes

### Tikhonov Damping vs Clamping
- **Tikhonov:** Add λ to all eigenvalues, then optionally clamp
  - `λ_new = clamp(λ_old + λ, min=λ_max/κ)`
- **Wrong (previous):** Only clamp without adding
  - Small eigenvalues get clamped but not regularized
  - Not equivalent to (F + λI)⁻¹

### Bias Augmentation
When a Linear layer has bias, activations are augmented: `[a; 1]`
- A becomes (in+1)×(in+1)
- Must use same augmentation in natural gradient computation
- Zero-bias fallback maintains consistency when bias grad is missing

### Eigenspace Operations
For symmetric positive definite M = VΛV^T:
- **Matrix multiply:** `Mv = V(Λ(V^T v))`
- **Powered matrix:** `M^p v = V(Λ^p(V^T v))`
- **Inverse:** `M⁻¹v = V(Λ⁻¹(V^T v))`

All use broadcast multiply, never materialize diag(Λ).

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Stale cache bug:** Run multiple K-FAC updates in sequence, verify natural gradients change
2. **lm_head OOM:** Test on model with 50k+ vocab (should run without GPU OOM)
3. **Bias consistency:** Layer with bias but no bias gradient (e.g., frozen bias)
4. **Memory usage:** Compare before/after for `compute_fisher_vector_product` on large models
5. **Numerical accuracy:** Verify natural gradient norms don't explode/collapse
