# Mathematical Fixes for Robinson Paper Implementation

## Date: 2025

This document details critical mathematical fixes applied to ensure correctness of the Robinson et al. "Token embeddings violate the manifold hypothesis" implementation.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Volume Calculation Bug (FIXED)
**File**: `robinson_fiber_bundle_test.py`
**Issue**: Volume count included the center point itself
**Mathematical Violation**: Volume at radius r should count neighbors within r, excluding the query point

**Before**:
```python
volumes[i] = np.sum(distances_to_point <= r)
```

**After**:
```python
volumes[i] = np.sum((distances_to_point <= r) & (distances_to_point > 0))
```

**Impact**: This bug would cause log-log slopes to be systematically biased, potentially masking true violations.

### 2. Curvature Calculation (FIXED)
**File**: `fiber_bundle_core.py`
**Issue**: Used 2D surface angle deficit formula for high-dimensional manifolds
**Mathematical Violation**: Angle deficit π - θ is only valid for 2D surfaces, not general manifolds

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced incorrect "Ricci curvature" with geometric regularity test
- Now uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to check angle distribution
- Added clear documentation that this is NOT Ricci curvature
- Uses sklearn's normalize for numerical stability

**Why**: True Ricci curvature requires:
- Optimal transport (Ollivier-Ricci)
- Heat kernel methods
- Or Riemannian geometric computations
All computationally expensive and require additional structure.

---

### 3. Intrinsic Dimension Estimation (FIXED)
**File**: `fiber_bundle_core.py`
**Issue**: Simple PCA doesn't work well for manifold dimension
**Mathematical Improvement**: Implemented Levina-Bickel Maximum Likelihood Estimator

**New Method**:
- Uses k-nearest neighbors distances
- Computes MLE: d = (k-1) / Σ log(r_k/r_i)
- Returns median for robustness
- Falls back to PCA if MLE fails

### 4. Statistical Testing Framework (FIXED)
**File**: `robinson_fiber_bundle_test.py`
**Issue**: Ad-hoc p-value computation didn't match paper's CFAR framework
**Mathematical Fix**: Implemented proper hypothesis testing

**New Framework**:
1. Mann-Kendall test for slope trends
2. Anderson-Darling test for normality of changes
3. CFAR-based discontinuity detection
4. Fisher's method to combine p-values
5. Proper Holm-Bonferroni correction

**Tests**:
- H₀: Embeddings lie on smooth fiber bundle
- H₁: Embeddings violate fiber bundle structure (increasing slopes)

---

### 5. Test Corrections (FIXED)
**File**: `test_robinson_fiber_bundle.py`
**Issue**: Expected volumes included self in count
**Fix**: Updated all expected values to exclude center point

**Example**: For radius r=1 from origin [0,0]:
- Before: Expected 3 points (including origin)
- After: Expected 2 points (excluding origin)

---

## Remaining Limitations

### What We Have:
✅ Correct volume growth computation
✅ Proper statistical testing
✅ Robust dimension estimation
✅ Geometric regularity tests

### What We Don't Have (from paper):
❌ Polysemy detection (linguistic analysis)
❌ Tokenizer integration
❌ Cross-model singularity comparison
❌ Semantic dimension measurement
❌ True Ricci curvature (too expensive)

---

## Mathematical Guarantees

### What We Can Claim:
1. **Volume growth patterns** are computed correctly per Robinson et al.
2. **Statistical tests** control false alarm rate properly
3. **Dimension estimation** uses proven MLE methods
4. **Numerical stability** through use of scipy/sklearn libraries

### What We Cannot Claim:
1. This is NOT a complete implementation of Robinson paper (missing linguistic components)
2. Curvature test is NOT Ricci curvature (it's geometric regularity)
3. Tangent space alignment assumes flat ambient space (no parallel transport)

---

## Usage Notes

### For Researchers:
- Use for detecting manifold hypothesis violations
- Combine with linguistic analysis for full Robinson implementation
- Consider computational cost for large embeddings

### For Production:
- All mathematical operations use stable library implementations
- Handles edge cases (single points, small neighborhoods)
- Returns confidence scores with results

---

## Validation

All fixes validated against:
1. Mathematical definitions (excluding self from neighborhoods)
2. Statistical literature (proper hypothesis testing)
3. Numerical stability (using established libraries)
4. Unit tests with known ground truth
