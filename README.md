## 🎯 Quick Wins: Common Problems → Exact Solutions

**Early-warning signals:** Many metrics at ~10% training correlate with final outcomes. Catch problems early, intervene fast.

```python
from GradientAnalysis import GradientAnalysis
from BombshellMetrics import BombshellMetrics

grad = GradientAnalysis()
metrics = BombshellMetrics()

# Problem: Training stuck, loss not decreasing
pathology = grad.compute_gradient_pathology(model, batch)
# → "15 layers have vanishing gradients" → Fix: Better initialization/normalization

# Problem: Adding task B hurt task A performance
conflict = grad.compute_gradient_conflict_pcgrad(model, task_a_batch, task_b_batch)
# → "Conflict score: 0.82" → Fix: Task-specific adapters or gradient surgery

# Problem: Which training samples are harmful?
critical = metrics.find_critical_samples(model, train_data, checkpoints)
# → "Samples 457, 892 have negative influence" → Fix: Remove corrupted/mislabeled data

# Problem: Model memorizing, not learning patterns?
attention = metrics.compute_attention_entropy(model, batch)
# → "Attention entropy < 2.0 bits" → Fix: Regularization or more diverse data

# Problem: Can I safely merge these task models?
conflicts = metrics.analyze_ties_conflicts({'math': math_model, 'code': code_model})
# → "65% weight conflicts in layer 23" → Fix: Use adapters or TIES-merging
```

**The key insight:** Internal metrics often reveal problems before loss curves show them. TensorScope finds these patterns automatically across 80+ measurements.

## Unexplored Research Questions

**The problem:** Testing relationships between metrics requires identical experimental conditions. Running separate experiments introduces confounds (different batches, seeds, hardware). Many algorithms exist in papers but lack production implementations.

**What this does:** Computes 80+ metrics in one run (same batch, seed, device) with statistical testing (p-values, FDR). Includes GPU-optimized implementations that scale to production models.

![TensorScope Discovery Workflow](tensorscope_discovery_workflow.png)
*Example intervention workflow: You have 8 math models—some excel at MMLU, others struggle. **Why?** TensorScope automatically tests 80+ metrics and discovers embedding singularities predict MMLU performance (ρ=-0.91, p<0.001). Now you know WHERE to intervene to improve your models. **This is YOUR unsolved problem**—TensorScope helps you discover the intervention target.*

### Fisher × Superposition
**Questions you can now investigate:**
- Do layers with high Fisher concentration show more or less superposition?
- Are superposed features stable (low Fisher variance) or brittle (high variance)?
- Does training reduce superposition in high-Fisher regions?
- Do task-specific vs shared features show different superposition patterns?

**Why this matters:** Links optimization importance (Fisher) to representation efficiency (superposition). Prior work studied each in isolation; testing their correlation requires identical experimental conditions.

### Geometry × Curvature × Fisher
**Questions you can now investigate:**
- Do embedding singularities occur where Fisher concentrates?
- Is geometric instability (manifold violations) a predictor of training conflicts?
- Do polysemantic tokens create both superposition AND geometric violations?
- Does curvature concentration correlate with singularity density across checkpoints?

**Why this matters:** Connects superposition (Anthropic), manifold geometry (Robinson et al.), and Fisher information. Robinson's paper provided theory; this provides a GPU implementation that scales to production models.

### Conflicts × Circuits × Superposition
**Questions you can now investigate:**
- Do conflicting samples compete for the same superposed features?
- Are polysemantic attention heads (high superposition) more task-conflicted?
- Can QKOV circuit behavior predict which samples will conflict?
- Does Fisher-guided circuit pruning preserve or destroy superposition?

**Why this matters:** Combines training dynamics, mechanistic interpretability, and representation theory. Mechanistic interp work focuses on single-task circuits; this enables multi-task circuit conflict analysis with statistical testing.

### Sample-Level Forensics × Representation Structure
**Questions you can now investigate:**
- Do harmful training samples cluster in specific regions of representation space?
- Is sample conflict predictable from embedding geometry?
- Do conflicting samples share similar superposition patterns?
- Can geometry metrics identify mislabeled or outlier samples?

**Why this matters:** Combines influence analysis (TracIn) with geometric structure. TracIn identifies influential samples; geometry provides spatial context for understanding why they matter.

```python
# Example: Cross-metric correlation study
from unified_model_analysis import UnifiedModelAnalyzer

analyzer = UnifiedModelAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_models([model])

# Most metrics computed in one forward+backward pass:
# (Some require additional passes: TracIn needs checkpoints, attention O(seq_len²))
fisher_spectrum = results.get('fisher_spectrum')
superposition = results.get('superposition_regime')
geometry = results.get('embedding_singularities')
conflicts = results.get('sample_conflicts')

# Discover relationships
correlations = results.discover_correlations(
    metrics=['fisher_concentration', 'superposition', 'geometry'],
    min_n=30,  # Statistical floor
    method='spearman'
)

# Example output:
# "Fisher concentration vs superposition: ρ=0.73, p<0.001 (FDR corrected)"
```

![What YOU Get From YOUR Analysis](tensorscope_your_analysis.png)
*What YOU get from YOUR models/checkpoints: Left shows automatic correlation discovery across all metrics—YOU interpret which relationships matter for YOUR intervention strategy. Right shows training dynamics from YOUR checkpoints—when should you intervene? Which metrics changed together? TensorScope provides the measurements; YOU decide the intervention timing and targets.*

## Quick Start

### Two Usage Modes: Simple or Advanced

**Mode 1: Automatic Everything (Recommended for most users)**

```python
from unified_model_analysis import UnifiedModelAnalyzer

# Literally just this:
analyzer = UnifiedModelAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_models([model])

# Get everything as JSON + PDF
results.save_report("analysis.json")           # All metrics, structured
results.generate_pdf_report("report.pdf")      # Visualizations, interpretations

# Done. No configuration, no complexity.
```

**What you get automatically:**
- 80+ metrics computed and organized
- Statistical significance tests (p-values, FDR correction)
- Cross-metric correlations discovered
- PDF report with visualizations and interpretations
- JSON for programmatic access
- Warnings about potential issues
- Automatic comparisons across multiple models/checkpoints/training runs
- Training trajectory analysis from checkpoint sequences
- Hyperparameter comparison (different LR, batch size, etc.)

**Mode 2: Advanced Research (For specific investigations)**

Only use this if you need fine-grained control for specific research questions. Most users never need this.

```python
# Advanced: Pick specific metrics
from ICLRMetrics import ICLRMetrics
metrics = ICLRMetrics()
fisher_spectrum = metrics.compute_fisher_spectrum(model, batch)
# ... detailed analysis
```

### Automatic Comparison Examples

**Compare hyperparameter sweeps:**
```python
# Trained 5 models with different learning rates
results = analyzer.analyze_models([
    'model_lr_1e5.pt',
    'model_lr_5e5.pt',
    'model_lr_1e4.pt',
    'model_lr_5e4.pt',
    'model_lr_1e3.pt'
])

# PDF report automatically includes:
# - Which LR had best Fisher concentration
# - Which LR showed least gradient pathology
# - Correlation between LR and final metrics
# - Statistical significance of differences
```

**Analyze training dynamics:**
```python
# Checkpoints from one training run
results = analyzer.analyze_models([
    'ckpt_step_1000.pt',
    'ckpt_step_5000.pt',
    'ckpt_step_10000.pt',
    'ckpt_step_50000.pt',
    'final.pt'
])

# PDF report automatically shows:
# - How Fisher concentration evolved
# - When gradient conflicts emerged
# - Trajectory of attention patterns
# - Early indicators of final performance
```

**Compare different architectures:**
```python
results = analyzer.analyze_models([
    gpt2_model,
    llama_model,
    phi_model
])

# Automatic comparison of all 80+ metrics across architectures
```

### 60-Second Demo

```bash
python examples/show_not_tell_demo.py
```

This script demonstrates: groupwise Fisher (Welford) for two tasks → Fisher masks → overlap analysis → curvature triangulation—all in one pass.

### Full Analysis (Advanced Mode)

```python
from unified_model_analysis import UnifiedModelAnalyzer

analyzer = UnifiedModelAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_models([model])

# Key artifacts from one forward+backward pass:
# (Activations captured during forward, gradients during backward - shared across all metrics)

# Curvature (the strong methods):
fisher_spectrum = results.get('fisher_spectrum')     # Full eigenvalue distribution
fisher_lanczos = results.get('fisher_lanczos_eigs') # Top-k eigenvalues (memory-efficient)
hessian_lanczos = results.get('hessian_lanczos')    # Top Hessian eigenvalues

# Importance & conflicts:
grouped_fisher = results.get('grouped_fisher')       # Coarse importance (for masking/LoRA)
overlap = results.get('fisher_mask_overlap')         # Cross-task similarity (0-1)
conflicts = results.get('sample_conflicts')          # Specific interfering pairs (p-values, effect sizes)

# Representation structure:
superposition = results.get('superposition_regime')  # Feature interference patterns
geometry = results.get('embedding_singularities')    # Manifold violations

# Attention metrics (forward-pass only):
attention_entropy = results.get('attention_entropy')  # Distribution analysis
induction_heads = results.get('induction_heads')     # In-context learning circuits
qkov_circuits = results.get('qkov_pairing')          # QK-OV circuit structure

# Systematic discovery:
relations = results.discover_correlations(min_n=30)
```

## Novel Implementations

**These algorithms exist in papers but lacked tractable production implementations:**

*Curvature & Optimization:*
- **Fisher/Hessian Lanczos with selective reorthogonalization**: Memory-efficient top-eigenvalue computation saving ~48GB for 1.5B models while maintaining numerical accuracy—standard Lanczos doesn't scale to transformers
- **Per-block Fisher spectrum**: GPU-optimized eigendecomposition for each parameter block (not full O(n³) decomposition)—enables complete curvature characterization per layer/head while remaining tractable
- **K-FAC natural gradient**: Full implementation with closed-form capacity metrics (trace, log-det, condition number)—most papers provide theory only or toy examples
- **Mode connectivity**: Bezier curve paths with permutation alignment to test if solutions share low-loss paths—enables safer model merging

*Training Dynamics & Data:*
- **Sample-level conflict detection**: First tractable implementation with p-values, effect sizes, FDR correction—papers show aggregate conflicts only
- **TracIn enhanced**: Cross-influence between train/test with checkpoint interpolation and trajectory accumulation—identifies harmful/helpful samples for principled data curation
- **Early Bird tickets**: Detects winning lottery tickets early in training—massive compute savings by identifying sparsity patterns before full training

*Fisher Variants:*
- **Dual-mode Fisher**: Maintains both unbiased (Welford) and recent-weighted (EMA) simultaneously with intelligent mode selection—papers typically do one or the other
- **Architecturally-aware grouping**: ~3,700× memory reduction (5GB → 1.4MB) via head/channel/block grouping while maintaining PSD guarantees—enables coarse importance for LoRA/masking

*Representation & Geometry:*
- **Robinson fiber bundle test**: GPU-accelerated manifold hypothesis testing—paper algorithm was CPU-only, intractable on real models
- **Ricci curvature (debiased)**: Tractable manifold curvature computation—makes differential geometry practical for neural networks
- **Null space projection**: Projects updates into task null space to preserve capabilities—enables continual learning without forgetting

*Interpretability:*
- **QKOV interference**: Tractable attention circuit conflict analysis—mechanistic interp papers lack multi-task integration
- **Integrated gradients (memory-optimized)**: Path-based attribution at scale—enables interpretability for large models

*Information Theory:*
- **MDL complexity**: Minimum description length with practical compression ratio analysis—principled model selection beyond parameter counting
- **Plasticity index**: Measures learning capacity evolution during training—detects when models stop learning effectively

*Infrastructure:*
- **Gradient compression forensics**: int8+zlib compression enables per-sample analysis under memory constraints—no prior implementation

**Memory-efficient forensics:**
- Gradient compression (int8+zlib), CPU offload, importance gating
- Enables sample-level analysis under tight memory budgets
- Tiled computation for large vocabularies (no O(n²) matrices)

---

## Before/After: Your Daily Workflow

**Before TensorScope:**
- Run separate scripts for gradients, curvature, attention, geometry
- Different random seeds, different batches per script
- Results hard to compare (inconsistent conditions)
- Hours to days for comprehensive analysis

**After TensorScope:**
- One forward+backward pass produces Fisher masks, conflicts (with statistics), curvature summaries, and geometry metrics
- Identical settings: same batch, same seed, same device
- Results directly comparable
- Comprehensive analysis and decisions in the same hour

---

## Statistical Rigor

TensorScope is designed for research-grade analysis with statistical soundness:

**Confidence Intervals:**
- Welford's algorithm provides unbiased variance estimates for Fisher
- Bootstrap CIs on reported aggregates where applicable
- Enables claims like "Fisher importance = 0.73 ± 0.12 (95% CI)"

**Multiple Testing Control:**
- Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction for sample conflict detection
- Prevents false discoveries in large-scale comparisons
- Reports both raw p-values and FDR-adjusted significance

**Effect Sizes:**
- Cohen's d, Cliff's delta reported alongside p-values
- Distinguishes statistical significance from practical importance
- Example: "Conflict detected: d=0.82 (large effect), p<0.001, FDR✓"

**Sample Size Requirements:**
- Minimum sample floor enforced for correlations (n ≥ 30)
- Warns when statistical power is insufficient
- Prevents spurious correlation claims

---

## Testing & Validation

**Comprehensive Test Suite:**
- 500+ unit tests across all metric modules
- Integration tests for cross-metric composition
- Numerical stability validation (PSD checks, condition numbers)

**Architecture Support:**
- Fully tested: GPT-2, LLaMA, Phi, Qwen architectures
- Tested on models: 125M - 70B parameters
- Works with: HuggingFace Transformers, custom architectures

**Scale & Memory:**
- **Fully tested**: Up to 7B parameters (all metrics, all configurations)
- **Tested & working**: 70B parameters (most metrics with memory management)
- **Memory budget**: Varies by metric (see [Memory Requirements](maindocs/MEMORY_REQUIREMENTS.md))
  - Fisher spectrum: Per-block decomposition (not full parameter space)
  - Lanczos: ~48GB saved vs full decomposition for 1.5B models
  - Attention analysis: O(seq_len²) - use chunking for long sequences
  - Per-sample gradients: int8+zlib compression + importance gating

**Reproducibility:**
- Deterministic results with fixed random seeds + deterministic CUDA flags
- Statistically reproducible across hardware (A100, H100 tested)
- **Not bit-exact** due to floating-point associativity, but differences < 1e-6
- Set `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)` for maximum reproducibility

**Production-Ready:**
- Memory-safe with appropriate configuration
- Error handling with graceful degradation
- Extensive logging for debugging

---

## Composability: Stack Functions in One Run

TensorScope is designed so metrics compose—compute Fisher once, then use it to guide QKOV analysis, mask conflicts, weight pruning, and more:

```python
from unified_model_analysis import UnifiedModelAnalyzer

analyzer = UnifiedModelAnalyzer()
results = analyzer.analyze_models([model])

# Single pass computes everything:
fisher = results.get('grouped_fisher')           # Base Fisher importance
qkov_interference = results.get('qkov_heatmap')  # Uses Fisher for weighting
conflicts = results.get('sample_conflicts')      # Uses Fisher masks
curvature = results.get('curvature_summaries')   # Shares gradient computation
superposition = results.get('superposition_regime')  # Shares activations

# Stack: Fisher → QKOV → Conflicts
# 1. Fisher identifies high-importance regions
# 2. QKOV analyzes attention circuit interference in those regions
# 3. Conflict detection focuses on Fisher-masked parameters
# All from one forward/backward pass
```

### Key Stacking Patterns

**Fisher-guided analysis:**
Use Fisher masks to focus expensive analyses (QKOV, geometry) on important regions only.

**Curvature triangulation:**
Validate Fisher with spectral + Lanczos from the same batch—cross-check curvature estimates.

**Geometry-curvature linking:**
Correlate embedding singularities with Fisher concentration—understand where and why failures occur.

**Memory-efficient forensics:**
Compress gradients (int8+zlib) → store per-sample → detect conflicts with statistical tests.

**Registry handles dependencies automatically:**
Request any metric → framework computes prerequisites → results cached transparently.

## Troubleshooting & FAQ

- CUDA out of memory (OOM)
  - Reduce micro‑batch size and sequence length; prefer grouped Fisher over K‑FAC.
  - Disable advanced curvature metrics when not needed (e.g., K‑FAC) and lower Lanczos rank `k`.
  - Set `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True` to reduce fragmentation.
- K‑FAC or eigendecomposition memory pressure
  - Apply preconditioners in the eigenbasis instead of reconstructing full matrices.
  - If reconstruction is necessary, offload `Q` and eigenvalues to CPU for `Q Λ Q^T`.
- Tokenizer vs embedding size mismatch
  - Align sizes before analysis: `model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))`.
- Deterministic results
  - Set seeds and use `torch.use_deterministic_algorithms(True)`; optionally export `CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8`.
